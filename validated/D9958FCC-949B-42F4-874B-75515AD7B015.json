  "summary": "The municipal government of Sakai in Osaka Prefecture said Monday personal information on all the around 680,000 voters in the 2011 Osaka gubernatorial election had been leaked on the Internet, as an employee had handled the data inappropriately. The city fired the 59-year-old male employee, who had access to data such as the names, birth dates and addresses of voters in the 2011 election, for taking the information home with him and storing it on a private rental server without permission, it said. [__] The city government has found there were 55 accesses to 15 of the 184 files on June 20 and 22. No secondary damage from the data leak has been confirmed, according to the city authority. ",
