  "summary": "A disgruntled employee announced his resignation and then was caught copying files from his computer to a flash drive.  Employees at Spellman began experiencing transaction and intranet disruptions after the disgruntled employee left even though his access to company servers was disabled after discovery of his suspicious activities.  The events began to occur sometime around January of 2012.  An investigation of the events led to the arrest of the former employee and federal prosecutors claim that he caused enough mayhem to cost Spellman over $90,000 by using his knowledge of Spellman's computer system and stolen passwords.  The former employee pleaded not guilty.",
