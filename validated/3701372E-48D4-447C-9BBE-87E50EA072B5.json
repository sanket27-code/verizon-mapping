  "summary": "A council has apologised after it sent confidential information regarding a clients mental health to a man living in Lancashire.  Bucks County Council was forced to send a courier 211 miles to Oldham to pick up the wrongly addressed letter at a cost of around 200.  The information contained sensitive details about a mans mental state.   Its recipient, Stuart Potter, was actually awaiting a letter from Bucks County Council regarding his mother Joyce Potter, 84, who lives in Stokenchurch.  He says he feared that his mothers letter had also been mixed up and sent to someone else.  Mr Potter said: To make matters worse I tried to speak to the person who wrote the letter and they never got back to me.  It was only when I got in touch with the legal department that they did anything about it, and I still havent had my mums report through.  Mr Potter, who was served with a legal notice stating he must not divulge the contents of the leaked report, added: Throughout this whole situation they have not addressed my concerns at all, they have sent this courier at great expense and could have sent my report with him too  Im still waiting.",
