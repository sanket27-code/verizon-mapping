  "summary": "A hacker got access to an emailed discussion about patients in the North Country who missed a health screening, leading to a massive breach-of-data warning.  About 25,000 patients were on a \u201cgap in care\u201d spreadsheet, identified in a variety of ways. Some were named with their birth date; some had Social Security numbers; and some had a Medicare or health insurance number included.  All of them were exposed to the hack of an Adirondacks Accountable Care Organization email inbox. However, officials don\u2019t know if the hacker actually looked at the spreadsheet. It was the only item in the email account with private data, said Gregory Daniels, chief compliance officer for the Adirondacks CEO.",
