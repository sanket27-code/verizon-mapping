  "summary": "Visitors to chase.com were shown a \"website temporarily down\" message on the front page, although the bank's mobile apps were said to be working.  Iran and a group of Islamic activists called the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters have been linked to internet attacks on major American banks, including US Bancorp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America.  The hacktivists claimed responsibility for a series of distributed denial-of-service attacks that hit those financial organisations in September, and declared JPMorgan Chase, SunTrust and PNC Financial Services Group were all possible targets for a second stage in its operations.",
