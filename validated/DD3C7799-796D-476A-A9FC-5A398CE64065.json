  "summary": "The Western Trust says it is investigating a data breach after a patient who had requested his medical records was given a file containing another persons records.  Jonathon had attended Altnagelvin Hospital with a heart condition and as he wasnt happy with his diagnosis he requested his medical records.  He told the Shaun Doherty Show today of his shock that his file contained 70 pages of another persons medical records: (audio file)  In a statement it said that there are many thousands of medical records used everyday and the Trust experiences very small numbers of data breaches annually.  The trust says it is working to address the error with those involved and the service area concerned.",
