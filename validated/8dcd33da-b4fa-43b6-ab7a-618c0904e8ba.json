  "summary": "Seyfarth Shaw fell victim to a crippling malware attack over the weekend, the global law firm disclosed earlier this week.  According to an official statement, unauthorized activity was detected by the company\u2019s monitoring systems on Saturday.  \u201cOn Saturday, October 10, 2020, Seyfarth was the victim of a sophisticated and aggressive malware attack that appears to be ransomware,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe understand that a number of other entities were simultaneously hit with this same attack. Our monitoring systems detected the unauthorized activity, and our IT team acted quickly to prevent its spread and protect our systems.\u201d  Although Seyfarth stressed that it found no evidence that client or internal data was removed or accessed, many computer systems were encrypted, forcing the IT team to \u201cshut them down as a precautionary measure.\u201d  The latest update suggests the company has not been able to bring its systems back online. However, it is coordinating with the FBI to track down the culprits.  \u201cOur team continues to work around the clock to resolve this incident,\u201d Seyfarth said on October 13. \u201cAs reported earlier, we have found no evidence that any of our client or firm data was accessed or removed.\u201d",
