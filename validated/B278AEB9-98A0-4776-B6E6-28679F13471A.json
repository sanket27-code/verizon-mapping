  "summary": "Employees concerned about potential for identity theft St. John's lawyer Bob Buckingham has filed a class-action lawsuit against Kiewit Energy for a privacy breach which happened earlier this year.  According to the statement of claim and an accompanying news release, a laptop computer containing personal payroll information for Kiewit employees was stolen from a rental car in Montreal earlier this year.  Buckingham said that at this point, he has no idea how many people are affected by the breach, but since Kiewit informed the Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia privacy commissioners, it seems like it might affect people across the country.  \"I have received hundreds of inquiries on this matter and Kiewit employees signing up to join the class action,\"__Buckingham said in the news release.  \"The class members are very concerned, upset and distraught knowing such confidential, private and personal information was stolen by criminal elements who could use it for nefarious illegal purposes, including impersonation and creating alternate personas.\"  Two Newfoundlanders _ Frank Butt from Carbonear and Ross Mercer from Bay Roberts _ are representative plaintiffs in the case.  Buckingham said Kiewit has not been very helpful to the employees who had their privacy breached.  \"We hope the filing of this class action will bring them to their senses, realize their corporate and employer responsibilities and work with us to mitigate losses and reduce damages,\" Buckingham said.  The Telegram requested a comment from Kiewit, but did not receive a response by deadline.  ",
