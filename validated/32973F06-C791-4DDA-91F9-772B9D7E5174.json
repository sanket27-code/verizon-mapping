  "summary": "Supercell, the developers of mobile game Clash of Clans, has confirmed the details of users on its official community forum that have been stolen by hackers. A breach notification website, LeakBase, claims that the leak involves roughly 1.1 million accounts.  The hacked information reportedly includes usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords and IP addresses, according to Motherboard which obtained and verified a small number of the forum's total accounts. Like many hacks before it, the incident has been blamed on forum-making software vBulletin.  On Wednesday (18 January 2017), the Helsinki-based firm released a statement about the incident. It was titled \"Your Supercell forum password may be at risk\" and claimed that the team had uncovered evidence the initial breach took place in September last year.  It said: \"To provide our forum service we use software from vBulletin.com. We're currently looking into [a] report that a vulnerability allowed third-party hackers to gain illegal access to some forum user information, including a number of emails and encrypted passwords.",
