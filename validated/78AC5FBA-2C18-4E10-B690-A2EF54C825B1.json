  "summary": "On February 8, 2013, we learned that a setting was inadvertently left open following application maintenance, which resulted in a human resources file folder becoming accessible to the Internet.  The file folder was part of the Lawson eProfile application and contained W-2 forms for employees from 2009 - 2012.  As a result, Internet search engines like Google may have indexed files in this folder.  Therefore, if someone entered your name as a search term, the file containing your W-2 could have been one of the results that appeared.  The information on a W-2 includes your name, address, SSN, and earnings information.  ",
