In the notification letter sent to patients, the office wrote that while all medical records were encrypted and inaccessible, on spreadsheet containing names and years of service may have \"been available.\" No Social Security numbers, birth dates, financial information, contact information or medical information were on the spreadsheet, according to the letter.  The letter indicates the risk for identity theft is minimal.",
