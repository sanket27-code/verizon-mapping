  "summary": "A device which police calls as a skimming device, used to copy passwords and other information of ATM card holders, was found on Sunday at a Metrobank branch at the Devera Hotel along Don Juico Avenue in Barangay Malabanias, Angeles City.  Michael Sta. Maria, a security guard, found the device which he first thought was an improvised explosive device.  Sta. Maria quickly informed the authorities when he discovered the wired device set up at the number pad of the banks ATM machine.  Authorities led by Senior Inspector Robledo Zinampan, were deployed in the area and they carefully detached the device from the ATM machine.  The device, he said, is used for recording PIN numbers of ATM cards.  The Angeles City police requested for the review of the banks CCTV footage at the ATM machine to ascertain the identity of the perpetrators.  Police also advised executives of the bank to look if there are other devices installed at the card receiver of the ATM machine. The skimming device will be subjected to technical analysis, police said.",
