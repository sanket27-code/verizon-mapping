  "summary": "A 33-year-old Enfield woman has pleaded not guilty to allegedly using the credit card of an elderly woman whom she was supposed to be assisting.  Lydia G. Hunter was working for Armistead Caregiver Services and was providing assistance to a 76-year-old Norwich woman when the elderly woman noticed she had an outstanding bill of about $5,000, according to a police report.  Hunter pleaded not guilty earlier this month to two felony charges of identity theft and financial exploitation of more than $500 of a vulnerable adult, as well as a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent credit card possession.  If convicted of all three charges, Hunter could be sentenced to a maximum of 13 1/2 years in prison.  According to a police report, the elderly Norwich woman was notified of the outstanding balance when she tried to renew her credit card. Police allege that the credit card was used at numerous stores where the victim doesnt frequent, including Un Dun in West Lebanon.

Police allege that the credit card was used at numerous stores where the victim doesnt frequent, including Un Dun in West Lebanon.  Hunter also pleaded no contest earlier this year in Lebanon District Court to a charge of attempt to commit unlawful dealing or possessing prescription drugs.  A police affidavit alleges that Hunter called in a prescription to Walgreens and said her name was Donna Travis and told the pharmacy that it was OK to fill the prescription early. Hunter was fined $500 and sentenced to 30 days, all suspended, according to court documents.  Hunter is scheduled for a status conference for the charges she faces in Vermont on Jan. 14.  ",
