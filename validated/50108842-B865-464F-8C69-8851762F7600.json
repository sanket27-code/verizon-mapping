  "summary": "HSBC Holdings Plcs (HSBA) Turkish unit said it lost 2.7 million customers bank data in a cyber-attack, after a similar security breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  The hack resulted in the theft of data on cards and related bank accounts, Europes biggest lender said in an e-mailed statement. The breach is limited to Turkey and shouldnt result in financial risk for customers, London-based HSBC said.  Government officials and security specialists around the world have said more needs to be done to prevent cyber-crime in the global financial system and protect customers after a series of high-profile hackings. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said last month 76 million households were affected by a data breach. EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Home Depot Inc. (HD) have also been attacked.  Its hard to know whether this is Turkeys worst security breach, said Selahaddin Karatas, founder of passwordless security company SAASPASS. The country hasnt historically enforced a requirement to disclose data breaches to victims, unlike those in force in more than 40 U.S. states, he said.  There have been breaches in the past, but because there was no obligation for transparency or disclosure it wasnt really made public, Karatas said by phone from San Francisco.  Cyber-attacks are rarer in many European countries than they are in the U.S. because of the prevalence of EMV, a system for authenticating bank card transactions, Karatas said.",
