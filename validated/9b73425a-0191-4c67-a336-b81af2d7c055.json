Most of the low code\u201d, cloud-hosted business intelligence applications are created using Microsoft Power apps as it ensures both internal as well as external users a secure access to their data. Power Apps UI also assists us built a website offering features including user authentication, forms for users to enter data, data transformation logic, storage of structured data, and APIs to retrieve that data by other applications. Although, even after discovering all this information still no evidence has been found regarding the data breach.  Moreover, it has also not been discovered yet how a cyber attacker was entered into a Microsoft power app\u2019s system. In the past few years, cyber attack cases are at a boom and according to UpGuard, the data breach could be a great lesson for the tech companies to strengthen their system against massive cyber attacks.
