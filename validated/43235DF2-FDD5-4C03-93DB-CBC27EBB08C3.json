  "summary": "Tokyo police have arrested a Chinese man on suspicion of illegally accessing a server operated by NTT Communications Corp.'s Internet service provider OCN, it was learned Tuesday.  The 32-year-old company employee, Geng Qiang, who lives in Tokyo, has admitted to the charge, informed sources said.  The Metropolitan Police Department identified another man, also in his 30s, who allegedly gave Geng instructions from China. The police will try to establish his whereabouts through Interpol.  Geng is alleged to have illegally accessed the OCN server by using the identification codes and passwords of three OCN users, including a Tokyo woman in her 50s, from a personal computer at his workplace in Chiyoda Ward on June 24, 2013.  Soon after the incident, NTT Communications announced that the passwords of OCN users had been changed by hackers. According to the police, 768 passwords were affected. Geng was involved in three of the cases.  Police in Japan have arrested Chinese nationals operating proxy servers used in illegal activities such as online banking fraud. The police believe that the man in China played a key role in the OCN cases, using Geng and the proxy servers.",
