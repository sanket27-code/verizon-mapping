  "summary": "In early May, 2008, Krivda resigned his employment with Plaintiff, Givaudan Fragrances (\"Givaudan\") where he was a perfumer. Prior to his last day on the job, Krivda allegedly downloaded and copied a number of formulas for fragrances. The parties acknowledge the formulas as trade secrets. Soon thereafter, Krivda commenced employment as a perfumer with Mane USA (Mane), a Givaudan competitor. Givaudan alleges that Krivda gave the formulas to Mane  an act of misappropriation. In this motion, Krivda's use of the computer assigned to him to access Givaudan's computerized formula management system is at issue.",
