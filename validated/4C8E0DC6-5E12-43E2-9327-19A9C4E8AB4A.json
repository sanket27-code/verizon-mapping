  "summary": "The Northshore School District is updating parents that student's emails were not hacked, instead were spammed after first warning parents that an outsider gained access to student emails. Now students are locked out of their emails with just weeks left in the school year, as the district investigates this serious security breach.  Some have described the emails as disturbing, with links to pornography and laced with profanity describing drugs, sex and violence.",
