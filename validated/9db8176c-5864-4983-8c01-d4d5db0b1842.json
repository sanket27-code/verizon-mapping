  "summary": "Hackers obtained personal data, including Social Security numbers and birth dates, from a Topeka company that manages information services for workforce agencies in 10 states, officials said Wednesday.  America\u2019s Job Link Alliance, a 50-year-old company, provides a web-based system that links job seekers with employers for Kansas, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont, a press release said.  The hack occurred on March 21 and was discovered by America\u2019s Job Link Alliance Technical Support, the arm of AJL that serves as its national information systems development and support center.  \u201cAJLA\u2013TS confirmed that a malicious third party \u2018hacker\u2019 exploited a vulnerability in the AJL application code to view the names, Social Security Numbers, and dates of birth of job seekers in the AJL systems of up to ten states,\u201d a company press release said. \u201cAJLA\u2013TS immediately intervened and deployed its technical team to assess and stop the incursion, disabling the hacker\u2019s access to the AJL systems.\u201d",
