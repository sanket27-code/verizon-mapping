  "summary": "A medical records coordinator at Cogent Healthcare in Hackensack stole the identities of multiple patients and used them to commit credit card fraud in late 2012, Bergen County prosecutors said Thursday. Latoyha S. Sapp, 37, of Wayne was being held on $35,000 bail in the Bergen County Jail after prosecutors charged her with trafficking in personal identifying information of another and computer-related theft.  Prosecutors arrested Sapp on Wednesday after learning that she allegedly acquired and distributed personal identifying information of multiple patients at Cogent Healthcare Incorporated, a company affiliated with Hackensack University Medical Center.  \"The patients' information was allegedly to be used to perpetrate credit card fraud in late 2012,\" Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said. \"The information leading to the arrest of Ms. Sapp was obtained from a larger identity theft investigation that was conducted by members of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office White Collar Crimes Squad in early 2013. That investigation led to the arrests of nine subjects in May 2013 for various identity theft and credit card fraud related crimes.\"  Authorities did not say how many patients at Cogent Healthcare or Hackensack University Medical Center were compromised.  \"HackensackUMC is fully cooperating with law enforcement and working with Cogent to ensure this is handled swiftly and all impacted patients are notified immediately,\" Hackensack University Medical Center said in a statement. \"We are sorry this situation occurred and will do everything in our power to assist our patients through this process. We are committed to working with Cogent to ensure that this doesn't happen again.\"",
