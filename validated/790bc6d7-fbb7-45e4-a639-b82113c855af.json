  "summary": "Columbia Surgical Specialists, which operates four medical offices in Spokane and Spokane Valley, says it paid hackers nearly $15,000 to decrypt patient information that was held hostage in a ransomware attack.  In a two-page notice sent to patients Thursday, the company said it learned about the hack on Jan. 9 and \u201ctook immediate action to evaluate the extent and nature of the intrusion and to address the source as soon as the vulnerability was discovered.\u201d  The company said the compromised files may have included patients\u2019 names, driver\u2019s licenses, Social Security numbers and personal health information.  \u201cWe received notice from the people that encrypted the files just a few hours before several patients were scheduled for surgeries, and they made it clear we would not have access to patient information until we paid a fee,\u201d the company said.  The doctors who own Columbia Surgical Specialists paid $14,649.09.  \u201cWe quickly determined that the health and well-being of our patients was the number one concern,\u201d the company said, \u201cand when we made the payment they gave us the decryption key so we could immediately proceed, unlocking the data.\u201d  The company said its cybersecurity provider, Intrinium, analyzed its systems and \u201cbelieves that no data was acquired, disclosed or used\u201d by the hackers, though patient records were exposed during the attack.  Columbia Surgical Specialists said it initially believed records of up to 400,000 patients may have been compromised, but \u201cafter further investigation, the actual number of potentially affected patients is substantially smaller.\u201d  The company\u2019s statement didn\u2019t say precisely how many patients might be at risk, nor did it say how the hackers made contact, how the doctors transferred the ransom money or what security measures were in place before the attack.",
