  "summary": "Meanwhile Samantha Jones, chief executive of West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust said staff had been informed of three information breaches.  She said: On two separate occasions, two members of staff sent staff data to their personal email address so they could work on it while out of the office.  Ms Jones said that as this was contrary to trust policy, those employees would be subject to disciplinary procedures.  In addition, staff data was accidentally sent to a staff member at another NHS trust.  None of the three breaches involved patient data.  However the type of data sent included information such as the name, date of birth, national insurance number, address, salary, professional registration and, if supplied by the staff member, their sexuality and religion.  Ms Jones said that immediate steps had been taken to prevent any further breaches, and an internal investigation has also been launched.  She added: I have apologised on behalf of the trust board to our staff.  But the breaches have been criticised by St Albans MP Anne Main who said: This raises a lot of questions. People need to know their data is safe, and this isnt good enough.",
