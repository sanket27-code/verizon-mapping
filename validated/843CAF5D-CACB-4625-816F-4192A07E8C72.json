  "summary": "According to court documents, Springdale police officers responded to a credit union on Sept. 28 after receiving a report that two individuals had been sitting in a car parked in an adjacent lot.   The subjects were seen individually walking to the ATM and returning to the vehicle. Springdale officers later approached the men and found evidence of possible credit card fraud, according to the the U.S. Attorney's office.  Upon further investigation, law enforcement officials say they discovered a device known as a skimmer and a pinhole camera attached to the ATM. ",
