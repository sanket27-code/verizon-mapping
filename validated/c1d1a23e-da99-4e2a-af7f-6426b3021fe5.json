  "summary": "More than 2.9 million Desjardins Group members have had their personal information compromised in a data breach targeting Canada\u2019s biggest credit union.  The incident stems from \u201cunauthorized and illegal use of internal data\u201d by an employee who has since been fired, Desjardins said Thursday in a statement. Computer systems were not breached, the cooperative said.  Names, dates of birth, social insurance numbers, addresses and phone numbers of about 2.7 million individual members were released to people outside the organization, Desjardins said. Passwords, security questions and personal identification numbers weren\u2019t compromised, Desjardins stressed. About 173,000 business customers were also affected.  Calling the matter a \u201cvery serious situation,\u201d Quebec\u2019s Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers nevertheless expressed confidence that Desjardins officials \u201chandled the situation with due rigour, transparency and speed and that the cooperation provided to law enforcement is full and complete. \u201c  The incident \u201chighlights the omnipresent risks to information security that all organizations must now contend with,\u201d the financial markets watchdog said in a statement.Desjardins said it learned of the breach when contacted by Laval police June 14. The company said it has implemented additional security measures to protect personal information, accounts and assets. It has also hired experts and is working closely with the Laval police.  \u201cI\u2019d like to reassure our members and clients: their accounts and assets with Desjardins are protected in the event of fraud,\u201d chief executive officer Guy Cormier said in the statement. \u201cIf they suffer a financial loss as a result of this situation, they will get their money back. We regret this situation and are making every effort to ensure that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d  All members affected will receive a letter from Desjardins.  As a precaution, Desjardins pledged to offer those affected a credit-monitoring plan and identity theft insurance for a year. Desjardins will pay for the plan.",
