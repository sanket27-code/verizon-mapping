  "summary": "Maplesoft is investigating a security breach of its administrative database that took place on July 17th, 2012. As a result of the breach, the perpetrators gained access to some email subscription data, including email addresses, first and last names, and company and institution names. Any financial information held by Maplesoft remains secure, and has not been affected by this security breach.  The perpetrators appear to be using email addresses they have taken from the database to spread viruses or malware. The perpetrators are posing as Maplesoft in an attempt to have individuals they email click on a link or download a malicious piece of software.  Recipients should not respond to these emails and they should not open any attachments or click on any download links. These emails should be deleted immediately. Maplesoft discovered the security breach after some of Maplesofts customers received what appeared to be a spam email.  Notification of the spam email was then immediately posted on the Maplesoft website. Upon investigation by Maplesofts IT staff, the security breach was discovered and Maplesoft took immediate corrective actions to stop the breach and prevent further unauthorized access to Maplesofts databases.   All of the individuals affected by the security breach have been alerted by Maplesoft directly.   Maplesoft takes the security of our customers and contacts personal information very seriously. We are in the process of notifying all individuals whose information may have been compromised, said Jim Cooper, CEO of Maplesoft. We have locked down our systems to prevent further unauthorized access and we are reviewing our security practices and procedures to help ensure this does not happen again.  We deeply regret any inconvenience or concerns that this situation may cause our contacts and customers, added Cooper.  ",
