These companies provided Medicaid for behavioral health services primarily in the Orlando area. According to the investigation, Craig and Leiba, both case management supervisors at Divine Consulting, billed for services not provided and not medically necessary. Lyons, who runs the Young Men of Promise program through the Orange County School system, allegedly sold high school students' identity information to Divine Consulting and Revive Athletics. The companies allegedly billed Medicaid for services to these students, but the students never received the services.",
