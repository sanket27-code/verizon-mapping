But the flames put plenty of lives on display as the crumpling warehouse belched up its contents: decades\u2019 worth of charred medical records, court transcripts, lawyers\u2019 letters, sonograms, bank checks and more. \u201cThey\u2019re like treasure maps, but with people\u2019s personal information all over them,\u201d Spencer Bergen, 24, said of the half-charred scraps that he said he had seen strewn around the Williamsburg neighborhood as far inland as Berry Street, several blocks from the warehouse.",
