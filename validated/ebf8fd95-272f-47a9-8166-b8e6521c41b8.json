  "summary": "John Boyega, who plays storm trooper-turned-resistance-fighter Finn in the new trilogy, confessed to the crime Wednesday on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d days after director J.J. Abrams and costar Daisy Ridley refused to reveal his name. True to Abrams\u2019 original account, the British star said he accidentally left a copy of the top-secret screenplay under his bed before it landed in the wrong hands.  \u201cAll right, all right, guys - it was me,\u201d he said. \u201cI was moving apartments, and I left the script under my bed. I was like, \u2018You know what? I will leave it under my bed. When I wake up in the morning, I\u2019ll take it and then move.\u2019 But then my boys came over and we started partying a little bit. And the script, it just stayed there. And a few weeks after, this cleaner comes in, finds this script and puts it on eBay for like 65 pounds. The person didn\u2019t know the true value.\u201d  Not surprisingly, Disney - notorious for its airtight, spoiler-proof security measures - was not pleased with Boyega\u2019s gaffe. Earlier this week, Abrams explained that the studio giant had distributed only \u201ca handful of scripts, and they were printed on crazy, uncopy-able paper.\u201d But it took only one human error for the coveted property, valued at about $84, to end up on an auction site.  \u201cIt was scary,\u201d Boyega said. \u201cI got calls from every official. Even Mickey Mouse called me, \u2018What did you do?!\u2019 \u201d  A day before his confession, Ridley, who stars opposite Boyega as Jedi scavenger Rey, cleared her own name on the morning show - and dropped a hint as to who was really to blame.  \u201cApparently, people assume it was me,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw the person under the bus ... but there is someone else potentially coming on the show this week who can answer the question as to who that was.\u201d  According to Abrams\u2019 story, Boyega was eventually let off the hook thanks to a sharp-eyed Disney staffer, who spotted and purchased the stolen script online before anyone else could. Since the incident, details about the highly anticipated conclusion to the Skywalker era have so far remained under wraps ahead of its Christmastime debut.  \u201cStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\u201d starring Boyega, Ridley, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver, hits theaters Dec. 20 Sign up for daily e-mail Wake up to the day\u2019s top news, delivered to your inbox Sign-up for other newsletters Upcoming Events",
