But what landed in Mr. Sinderbrand\u2019s hands on July 8 went far beyond what his lawyer had asked for: Wells Fargo had turned over \u2014 by accident, according to the bank\u2019s lawyer \u2014 a vast trove of confidential information about tens of thousands of the bank\u2019s wealthiest clients.",
