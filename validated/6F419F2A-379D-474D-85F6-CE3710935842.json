  "summary": "University Gastroenterology (\"UGI\") has become aware of a data security incident that may have resulted in the inadvertent exposure of the personal and protected health information of some patients. Although at this time there is no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of anyone's information as a result of this incident, we have taken steps to notify our patients and provide resources to assist them. On July 11, 2016, we discovered that an unauthorized individual had gained access to an electronic file storage system from a practice we acquired in 2014, Consultants in Gastroenterology, and encrypted several files. We immediately took action to secure our system and conducted an investigation to determine what information was contained in those files. We determined that some files may have contained patient names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and medical billing information. Patients' electronic medical records were not exposed and remain secure.",
