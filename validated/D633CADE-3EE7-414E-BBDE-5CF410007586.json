  "summary": "On Tuesday, May 27, we discovered unauthorized activity on a website maintained by our company, Craftsman Book Company. On May 28 we sent a message recommending a change of your password on the Craftsman site: http://craftsman-book.com/products/index.php?main_page=login. Since then, we have discovered unauthorized activity that could result in a fraudulent charge to your credit or debit card  such as a charge of $100 for a Starbucks Card Reload or a purchase at Zappos.Com. We have no way of knowing if you are affected. So were sending this message as a precaution as quickly as possible -- before all details are known and before any investigation by law enforcement authorities. Heres what we know so far. By making repeated attempts beginning March 9, 2014, a hacker was able to break through password security on the Craftsman site Construction-Contracts.net. No personal information is stored on this site. But using whats called a SQL injection attack, the hacker was able to access Craftsman-Book.com, a website hosted on the same server as construction-contract.net. Once admitted to Craftsman- Book.com, the hacker found sensitive files, including customer names, billing addresses, credit card numbers and expiration dates. No CVV numbers and no financial passwords were compromised because Craftsman does not collect that information. ",
