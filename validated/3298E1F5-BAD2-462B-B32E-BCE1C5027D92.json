During the period of July 19, 2012-October 2, 2012 this activity resulted in the malicious user being able to view some Wilton/Copco user information, including name, address, city, state, telephone, and payment card information, including card number, expiration date and security codes (e.g. CVV2/CVC2/CID). We believe that your personal information could have been accessed as a result of this incident.",
