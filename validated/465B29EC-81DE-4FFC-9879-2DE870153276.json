  "summary": "Alberta Health Services (AHS) is notifying approximately 5,000 patients after a laptop was stolen from a local clinic. The laptop, stolen from the Lethbridge Sleep Clinic on Oct. 17,  was not owned by AHS and not connected to any AHS network. The laptop contained a database with the names and addresses of patients, dates of services and types of equipment used by the clinic. The laptop and database were password protected but not encrypted. The laptop did not contain information such as an individuals Alberta Health Care Number. The theft was reported to the Lethbridge Regional Police Service. Any breach of patient information, even one such as this that doesnt impact patient care or health information, is inexcusable, said Sean Chilton, chief zone officer, South Zone. Its unfortunate this theft of clinic property occurred, and we sincerely apologize to any patient impacted by this breach of our information safeguards. AHS Privacy is now working with South Zone leadership to notify the individuals whose demographic information was contained on the laptop. AHS Privacy will continue to work with clinic staff to review safeguards and ensure appropriate measures have been taken to prevent this from happening again. There is no indication that the information was targeted for fraudulent purposes, and we believe the risk of identity theft is low, said Chilton. He added AHS has stringent policies in place regarding the safeguarding of health information, and all employees and contractors are expected to act in accordance with these policies, as well as Albertas privacy legislation. Alberta Health and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner have been notified.",
