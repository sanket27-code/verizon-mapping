A clerical error resulted in patient letters being sent to the wrong addresses. The letters named the patient, their doctor and the name of the practice they were seeing.  None of the letters disclosed social security numbers, dates of birth or insurance information.  Patients are being individually notified of the mix up. Cone Health regrets any confusion resulting from the incorrect mailing.",
