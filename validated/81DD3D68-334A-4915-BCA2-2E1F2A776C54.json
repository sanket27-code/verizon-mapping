  "summary": "A Michigan medical center could be facing harsh scrutiny after a news report stated that medical files were found dumped outside near the building.  According to a Local 4 report, a patient who was picking up a prescription found a stack of boxes outside. The files contained Social Security numbers, X-rays, blood types and addresses of former patients for Dr. Pramod Raval.  I had a strong hunch something was wrong when I saw the boxes. I went over there and grabbed some and it was medical records, all kinds of personal information, Julius Williams told the news source about when he found the boxes. I was afraid that all of my information was somewhere in that dumpster, too.  Previously, Raval was one of 13 people indicted in a $14 million Medicare home healthcare fraud scheme, reported the news source. While Raval was convicted in 2012, he died in 2013 before serving any prison time. His sentencing date was scheduled in January of this year. The doctors office was turned over to a bank and then sold to Hope Pharmacy.  According to pharmacy workers, they didnt know what kind of files had been left in the building but said that contractors were brought in to clear everything for a remodel. Oak Park police explained that a shredding company was scheduled to come in and destroy the files. However, officers said they didnt know why that wasnt done before the files were dumped.",
