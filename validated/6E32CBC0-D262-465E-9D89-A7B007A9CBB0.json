  "summary": "Customer records found for sale on the dark web.  This incident is not listed in the HHS database under either of the companies names listed.    Sure enough, the source who alerted me to this listing had obtained numerous fullz from this seller. All of them contained the personal and financial information on people in the Northwest United States (mostly in Washington state) whod applied for life insurance through American Income Life, an insurance firm based in Waco, Texas.   American Income Life referred all calls to the companys parent firm  Torchmark Corp., an insurance holding company in McKinney, Texas. This publication shared with Torchmark the records obtained from Imperial Russia. In response, Michael Majors, vice president of investor relations at Torchmark, said that the FBI and Secret Service were assisting the company in an ongoing investigation, and that Torchmark expected to begin the process of notifying affected consumers this week.  Were aware of the matter and weve been working with law enforcement on an ongoing investigation, Majors said, after reviewing the documents shared by KrebsOnSecurity. It looks like were working on the same matter that youre inquiring about.  Majors declined to answer additional questions, such as whether Torchmark has uncovered the source of the data breach and stopped the leakage of customer records, or when the company believes the breach began. Interestingly, ImperialRussias first post offering this data is dated more than three months ago, on June 15, 2014. Likewise, the insurance application documents shared with Torchmark by this publication also were dated mid-2014.",
