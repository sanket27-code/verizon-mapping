  "summary": "A Lincoln medical practice is warning that some patients may have had personal and financial information exposed to hackers.  Complete Family Foot Care at 1001 S. 70th St., Suite 105, said Wednesday that a contractor it uses for the management and online storage of electronic health records experienced an unauthorized access to the servers containing those electronic health records sometime in 2015. Complete Family Foot Care was notified in the first week of January.   The contractor's servers contain patient files from a number of different healthcare providers, and Complete Family Foot Care was unable to determine which, if any of its records, were compromised.  Complete Family Foot Care said there is no evidence any patient's information has been misused, but patients whose information may have been viewed are being provided complimentary identity recovery services from IdentityForce for 12 months.
