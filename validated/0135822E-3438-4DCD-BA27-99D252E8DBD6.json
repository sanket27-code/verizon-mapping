  "summary": "The website has been hacked by someone claiming to be linked to Islamic extremists. The homepage of the Terrasse-Vaudreuil municipality website boasts a message which includes:   \"We are Muslims. Quran is our book. In Allah we trust. For Allah we work. SCREW YOU Charlie Hebdo.\"  It continues to praise the religion of Islam.   The message is signed by a group calling itself the Middle East Cyber Army. It is not known who is actually responsible for the hack.   Terry Cutler, a hacker said Terrasse-Vaudreuil was probably just an easy hack.   \"What they do is they go to Google, they run these special searches _ 'Show me everybody in Canada running this specific version of the software of this website,'\" Cutler said,  adding that hackers then launch a script that hacks into all the sites.   He said it's likely just an attempt to find a platform to promote a certain message. ",
