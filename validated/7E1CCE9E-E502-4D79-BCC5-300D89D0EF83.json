  "summary": "A Florissant orthodontist's office has informed 10,000 people that their personal information could be compromised because of a break-in and burglary at its offices in July.  The patients' personal information included names, addresses, X-rays, photos and diagnostic findings. The parents', or insured party's, information included names, emails, Social Security numbers and credit scores.  Olson & White Orthodontics, which also has offices in O'Fallon, Mo., was burglarized on July 22. Thieves took computers containing personal data, including patient health information, according to Armstrong Teasdale, the Clayton-based law firm hired by Olson & White after the break-in.",
