  "summary": "Nissan Canada is in the process of notifying 1.13 million customers of a data breach that might have exposed their information.  On 11 December, the automobile manufacturer\u2019s Canadian headquarters discovered that both Nissan Canada Finance and INFINITI Financial Services Canada had suffered a data security incident.    As disclosed in a press release published by Marketwired, customers who financed the purchase of their vehicles through those two business arms might be affected by the breach, an event which is believed to have exposed their name, address, vehicle make and model, vehicle identification number (VIN), credit score, loan amount, and monthly payment. Nissan Canada has not found any evidence indicating the exposure of customers\u2019 payment card information.",
