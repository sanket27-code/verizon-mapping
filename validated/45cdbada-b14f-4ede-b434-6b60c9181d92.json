  "summary": "A Montgomery pharmacist is facing legal action for allegedly revealing her customers' private information.  The Alabama State Board of Pharmacy has also taken action against pharmacist Dee Parks.  According to court documents, Parks is the focus of a civil malpractice suit for allegedly giving patient information to a third party.  Attorney Virginia Lucci says Parks issued a lease to one of Lucci's client. On the back of the lease were three dozen patients of Parks Pharmacy, along with their prescription information, doctor's name and doctor's number.  Lucci says it appears Parks decided to print the lease on the blank side of a paper that had been used for her pharmacy's dispensing report log.",
