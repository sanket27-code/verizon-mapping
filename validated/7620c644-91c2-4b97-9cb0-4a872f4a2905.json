  "summary": "Thousands of New York residents who live in buildings run by Douglas Elliman\u2019s property management arm may have had their personal information compromised this month.  Douglas Elliman Property Management\u2019s three managing directors emailed hundreds of co-operative and condominium boards Monday to advise them that the company\u2019s IT network \u2014 which contains data for its buildings\u2019 residents and employees \u2014 was breached and their personal information may have been compromised.   In the message viewed by The Real Deal, executives said the firm detected \u201csuspicious activity\u201d on its IT systems April 7. After launching an investigation and contacting law enforcement, Elliman determined that an \u201cunauthorized party\u201d gained access to its IT network between April 5 and April 7 and including files containing owners\u2019 and employees\u2019 personal data. A source with knowledge of the situation said the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved.  Information that may have been compromised includes names, dates of birth, mailing addresses, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, passport numbers and financial information, according to the email. The company has not found any identity theft related to the breach.",
