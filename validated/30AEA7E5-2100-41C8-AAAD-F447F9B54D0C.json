  "summary": "The Effingham County Sheriff's Office says they recently found a skimming device inside a local gas pump.   Investigator Bobby McQuaig tells WSAV that the pump had been pried open and the device was attached to the computer inside.  Investigators say whoever put it there wanted to collect debit and credit card numbers, and use them to steal your cash.  \"This one here they had actually made forced entry on the pump and caused a little bit of damage,\" explained Investigator McQuaig. \"But unless you were specifically looking for it the damage was only about the size of a top of a pencil eraser.\"  The Sheriff's office is now warning gas stations in the area to check their pumps for any tampering.   As for customers, just try to keep an eye out for anything unusual at the gas station, and at the pump and report anything that doesn't look right.  They add that at this time they are not sure how much, if any, personal information has been compromised, but they plan to launch a full investigation.",
