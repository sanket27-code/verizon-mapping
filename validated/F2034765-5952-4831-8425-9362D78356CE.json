They then used this information to create and submit false claims to Medicare through the clinics owned by Ulysses Acquisitions.  These claims sought reimbursement for therapy services that were not legitimately prescribed and not actually provided.  Duluc admitted that he and his co-conspirators created and used false and forged patient records in an effort to conceal the fact that services had not actually been provided.",
