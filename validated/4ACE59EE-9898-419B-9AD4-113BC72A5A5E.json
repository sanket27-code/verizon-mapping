  "summary": "The chief of a sweepstakes agency has been indicted over selling the personal data of some 4.85 million people and fraudulently changing the winners of giveaways, thus pocketing some 8 billion won (US$6.9 million) in total, the prosecution said Monday.  The indicted chief, surnamed Seo, is accused of illegally having collected the personal data through a variety of sweepstakes events and sold them to three local insurance firms for 7.2 billion won.  Most people who entered the contests were unaware that their personal information would be sold to insurance companies as such details were provided in barely visible fine print on the coupons. Also, he is charged with fraudulently replacing some of the winners of prizes with his acquaintances, the prosecution said.  In February, Homeplus Co., the South Korean unit of British retail giant Tesco PLC, was also indicted on charges of illegally selling the personal data of 24 million customers to insurance firms for a total of 23 billion won.  Most of the information was collected under the guise of conducting a lottery for free gifts.  Homeplus chief Do Sung-hwan, five other former and current company executives and employees as well as two officials from the insurance companies have also been indicted over their involvement in the case.
