  "summary": "A woman is facing felony charges after allegedly stealing more than$16,000 from special needs patients.  Christine Louise Yetter, 46, of Douglassville has was arrested by Lower Pottsgrove Police following a six-month investigation of missing funds from three special needs patients, according to a press release from police.  Police discovered that Yetter had been taking money from patients she cared for while employed at KenCrest, a special needs facility in Lower Pottsgrove.  Yetter had access and control of three patients funds so that she could assist them with buying items they needed for daily activities and necessities.  The investigation showed that Yetter used the money designated for those needs to eat at restaurants and purchase food, groceries and clothes. Yetter had spent over $16,000 of the patients money over a two-year period of caring for them. The clients did not benefit from or receive any of the purchases Yetter made with their money, police said.  Yetter is facing three counts each of access device fraud, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception, receiving stolen property and identity theft. She was arraigned before District Judge Edward C. Kropp on Jan. 20 and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing again before Kropp on Feb. 4. She was released on $10,000 unsecured bail.",
