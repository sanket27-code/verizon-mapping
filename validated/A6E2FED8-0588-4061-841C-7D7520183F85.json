  "summary": "Methodist Hospital officials say patient information is secure after discovering the hospital's network had been infected with a virus.  According to a news release, a ransomware virus got into the system. Ransomware restricts access to the infected computer system and demands that the user pay a ransom to remove the restriction to allow access to its own data and information.  Hospital officials stressed that no patient information was compromised.  The release said the hospital's Information Systems department immediately shut down the system to prevent the virus from spreading.  \"The IS department was able to identify and quarantine the issue,\" said Jamie Liles, Methodist's manager of development and community outreach. \"And no patient information was impacted. Our IS department has been working around the clock to resolve the issue.\"  While the system was down, a back-up system was activated.  \"Our IS department will work over the weekend to fix the problem,\" said Liles. \"They just don't want to put the primary system back up until the problem is resolved.\"",
