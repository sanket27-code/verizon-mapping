  "summary": "A nurse practitioner took documents from her desk, and shared them with unauthorized parties. She supposedly did this as part of a \\\"whistleblower\\\" effort for compliance issues, but was subsequently terminated. She filed suit, but the court found no evidence shows she was discharged for contacting a compliance officer about good-faith questions or concerns; rather, she violated confidentiality policies.  The documents contained protected patient health information, including name, date of birth, condition, diagnosis, and treatment provided.",
