  "summary": "Secret Service agents suspect the men who placed a card-skimming device on an ATM in Charleston were not local residents.  Bill Smarr, Charlestons Secret Service resident agent in charge, said Monday that the evidence looked similar to what investigators have found in surrounding states. He said its unlikely those involved are local residents.  A skimmer was reportedly placed on an ATM at the City National Bank branch on MacCorkle Avenue at 36th Street in Kanawha City the evening of July 12. It was on the machine for about an hour and a half, Craig Stilwell, executive vice president of retail banking at City National Bank, told the Daily Mail last week.  The devices, which are placed over the slot where the card is inserted, look inconspicuous to the average ATM user, but they store information like PINs from cards that are swiped.  About a dozen customers used the machine in that time. Six of them had attempts made on their funds, according to the bank. Stilwell said the bank restored their accounts and reported the device to Secret Service. ",
