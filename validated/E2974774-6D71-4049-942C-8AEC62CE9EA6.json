  "summary": "The pinheads over at LulzSec have crossed a major line. They hacked into the Arizona Department of Public Safety and published the names, addresses and other personal information of police officers (including their wives names and email addresses). They also published a lot of privileged material regarding ongoing operations, training and intelligence.  As a prosecutor, your home address is sacrosanct. You are sometimes viewed as the reason some defendant is going to jail. It gets personal, sometimes real personal. On September 25, 1995, Paul McLaughlin, a prosecutor in Boston, was murdered by a gang member he was prosecuting. He was killed in the parking lot of a commuter rail station. He was on his way home and the murderer knew which train he took. The murderer probably didnt know where he lived.  Lulz Security's hacking continues to get political: on Friday the group attacked the Arizona Department of Public Safety in retaliation for immigration laws. \"We are releasing hundreds of private intelligence bulletins, training manuals, personal email correspondence, names, phone numbers, addresses and passwords belonging to Arizona law enforcement,\" LulzSec said in a statement. \"We are targeting AZDPS specifically because we are against SB1070 and the racial profiling anti-immigrant police state that is Arizona.\"  ",
