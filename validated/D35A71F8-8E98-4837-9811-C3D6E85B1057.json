  "summary": "Yesterday, the Chinese internet was shaken by the news that IT portal and community CSDN has been hacked and data for its more than six million users had been stolen, including usernames and passwords. Today, reports have it that CSDN wasnt the only site affected.  Duowan, a games site, was hacked and hackers stole the data of its over eight million users. 7K7K, also a gaming site, reportedly lost data for 20 million users, and hackers also got info from 10 million accounts by hacking 178.com, another game site. Rumors are spreading that the hacks and leaked data may also have affected major social networking sites like Renren (NYSE:RENN) and Kaixin, but those claims appear to be unsubstantiated (at least for now).  Actually, aside from the CSDN hack, none of the other hacks have been officially confirmed yet; however, much of the stolen account information has been published online (see, for example, the image of Duowan usernames and passwords above), so the reports appear to be fairly accurate. This certainly appears to be very bad news for Chinese net users  and gamers in particular  but well keep an eye on this and update once more has come to light.",
