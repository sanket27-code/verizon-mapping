Olivia Franc pleaded guilty Sept. 2 to the multiple health information breaches in contravention of the Health Information Act (HIA), said a Thursday release from the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (OIPC). With no legitimate reason to do so, Franc admitted she looked into health records of close acquaintances, friends and others in the community while she worked at the Smith Clinic in Camrose. In one case, she further disclosed an individual\u2019s health information to a friend.  The OIPC opened an investigation into the unauthorized accesses of health information after Franc\u2019s employer in the town, about 95 kilometres west of Edmonton, reported the privacy breach in June 2018.  The OIPC concluded its investigation before referring its findings to the Specialized Prosecutions Branch of Alberta Justice. Charges were laid in July 2019.  It is an offence under HIA to knowingly gain or attempt to gain access to health information in contravention of the Act (section 107(2)(b)).  This case marks 15 convictions for unauthorized access to health information under HIA since 2001. Of those, 13 convictions have occurred since April 2014.",
