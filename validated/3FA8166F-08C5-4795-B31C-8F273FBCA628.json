  "summary": "There has been a breach of security of Deutsche Telekom employees' personal data, Handelsblatt reported. A company spokesman confirmed a report in Manager Magazin to this effect, and said a limited number of staff members have had access to employees' personal data that ought to have been kept in anonymous form only. He added that there were no signs that the information had been misused. He said the supervisory board had apologised to staff. An external auditor will be commissioned to investigate the privacy breach, and the works council wants a lawyer to be involved, too.  Handelsblatt said this case is embarassing to the company as CEO Rene Obermann has expanded data protection in recent years and even set up a separate directorate for the issue. Three years ago, a former security head was sentenced for participating in illegal spying on journalists and employee representatives on the supervisory board.",
