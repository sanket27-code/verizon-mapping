  "summary": "THE Information Commissioner has ordered an \"enforcement investigation\" into the Belfast health trust following the loss of \"sensitive personal data\" linked to a covert operation into allegations of sectarianism.  Correspondence sent by the commissioner to a former security guard at Belfast City Hospital acknowledges the \"extreme upset\" caused by the trust's secret monitoring of him.  The letter also notes that it is \"unlikely\" the trust complied with data protection laws in terms of protecting personal information.  Earlier this month, The Irish News revealed that the trust had installed listening devices and a hidden camera in the hospital to probe allegations of \"toxic\" sectarianism among security staff.",
