The vehicle was stolen from outside a GP practice in Surrey after collecting test samples from 10 practices across the area to take to the Epsom and St Helier pathology service.  Wimbledon GP and GPC member Dr Paul Cundy, whose practice uses the pathology service, said: Its outrageous. It is not acceptable for vans with clinical material in them to be left unattended with the keys in them. Theres no excuse for that.
