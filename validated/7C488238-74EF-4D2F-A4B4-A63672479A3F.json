  "summary": "Two alleged gang members were arrested early today on suspicion of burglarizing a Santa Clarita Valley office and taking computers, most likely for the purpose of identity theft, a Sheriffs Department official said.  At least one of the suspects was identified by investigators as a member of the Grape Street Crips gang in Los Angeles, Lt. Mark Hershey said. The other, also believed to be a gang member, was from the Antelope Valley.  The two men allegedly broke into an insurance office in the 19000 block of Soledad Canyon Road in Canyon Country around midnight and stole at least two computers.  Hershey said investigators believe the suspects wanted the computers for the purpose of stealing clients information for use in identity theft scams.  But deputies pulled the suspects over on Soledad Canyon Road shortly after midnight and arrested them without incident upon observing the computers in their vehicle, the lieutenant said.",
