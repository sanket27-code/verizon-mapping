  "summary": "The Hamilton Children's Aid Society is apologizing to a city woman for mistakenly disclosing confidential information about her to her business partner.  Ayla Smith, 28, says the breach happened after her partner Robert Johnston, with whom she also shares an apartment, requested a copy of his file over recent allegations made about him.  Inside the more than 300 pages released to him, he received information about Smith that included comments about her time in care of the CAS while she was a youth, and that made reference to her as a drug user and alcohol abuser, which Smith insists is dead wrong.",
