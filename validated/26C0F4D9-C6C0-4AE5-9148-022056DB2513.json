  "summary": "A person obtained patient information from Montgomery Obstetrics & Gynecology in Blacksburg in September, but the practice said Friday that it doesnt appear the information was used improperly. On Sept. 11, the practice learned that someone obtained access to multiple patients charts and other medical records that were removed from the practice, according to a news release from the medical practice. The information included patient names, dates of birth, home addresses, medical information  in most instances limited to the purpose of a visit  and, in a limited number of instances, Social Security numbers. How many patients records, who the person was who took the information, and when patients were notified was not provided in the news release. Montgomery OB-GYN recovered all of the documents the following day, according to the news release. The practice hasnt received any indication that the person suspected of obtaining the information used it improperly. The practice notified affected patients through letters about the breach, according to the news release. The letters outlined the type of information that was taken and recommended actions patients should take, such as checking with their banks and registering with credit monitoring services. As a result of the breach, Montgomery OB-GYN said it has taken steps toward improving security of patient information, including transferring to a password-protected electronic record system to ensure the breach was an isolated incident.",
