Police say once in the server, he accessed corporate and personal information, but wouldn't elaborate on the type of records that were obtained.  \"He did commit crimes in the sense that he accessed [information] unlawfully, but with the information he gained, we're not aware of any additional crimes that were committed,\" said Staff Sgt. Ryan Jepson. \"Other than__screenshots that were sent to the media, I'm not aware of what else may have been done with the information.\"  Police encourage any victims or people who think they may've been a victim to report it to police.

This claim is being actively investigated. We are also complying with all of our obligations under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. This person may be seeking notoriety and publicity for his/her actions.\"  Police say no further details will be released \"in relation to how the suspect gained access to the server.\"  Police say the CBE took steps at the time of the incident to notify parents of students who were impacted.
