  "summary": "05/22/13:  On May 20, the Privacy Office received a complaint that an employee located on 16 West noticed that a Sony VAIO desktop that was in the office on Friday at 4:45 pm was missing on Monday at 8:15 am. The computer was password protected, but not encrypted. It was purchased by New York University, but used by VA staff not on the VA network. The employee believes that the computer was stolen and reported the missing computer to VA Police on May 20.  The computer contained memos for 23 Syracuse VA patients containing full name, full SSN and HIV Resistance status, results of the HIV Viral Load/Resistance exam. The memos were generated because the VA staff does not have access to the medical charts for patients to enter the information. The template memo was created in this computer so they can draft a memo and include it with the test results when faxing to the lab at Syracuse. The Syracuse VA does not have the equipment to perform the tests and it is more cost effective for NYHHS to do the testing.",
