  "summary": "Hackers have infected the infrastructure of Parkview Medical Center \u2014 the largest health center in Pueblo County, Colorado \u2014 with cryptocurrency ransomware.  Citing a hospital employee, Fox News reported on April 24 that Meditech \u2014 the Parkview Medical Center\u2019s system for storing patient information \u2014 was infected with ransomware and rendered inoperable. The hospital confirmed the incident in a statement:  \u201cOn Tuesday, April 21, Parkview Medical Center was the\u202ftarget \u202fof a cyber-incident which has resulted in an outage in a number of our IT systems.\u201d  As Cointelegraph recently reported, ransomware attacks against hospitals are ongoing, despite the fall in the overall number of attacks amid the coronavirus crisis.  Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cybersecurity firm Emsisoft, told Cointelegraph that because of the ongoing pandemic \u201cransomware attacks have the potential to be devastating and could very well result in the loss of life.\u201d   Callow also said that because of this, some cybercrime groups may now be more motivated to attack hospitals than usual:  \u201cCertain actors may well be more motivated to attack healthcare providers at this point in time. Hospitals are already strained \u2014 overwhelmed, in some cases \u2014 and criminals may believe they would have no option but to pay, and to pay very quickly.\u201d  Parkview Medical Center also told Fox that it has switched to a paper record system to track and treat patients:  \u201cUpon learning of the incident, Parkview immediately engaged leading third-party forensic experts to investigate and mitigation\u202fis well underway. Patient care is always our first priority. Patients will not see any impact to the level or quality of care being delivered.\u201d",
