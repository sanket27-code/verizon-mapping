  "summary": "A Veteran employee asked the Information Security Officer (ISO) to conduct a sensitive record access report for their CPRS record. The employee noticed that two people had accessed his record on Dec 28, 2012. The employee has not received care at the VA since 2004. One of the employees who accessed the record was a nurse the other was a work study. When the Privacy Officer interviewed the nurse, she had no recollection of accessing the record but admitted that she often leaves her computer and CPRS logged in an others then use her access. The employee whose record was accessed is very upset and it is clear the access was not authorized.",
