  "summary": "Massachusetts-based Sports Medicine & Rehabilitation Therapy (SMART) has alerted 7,000 patients to a breach of their protected health information. Potentially, the breach impacted all patients whose information was recorded during a visit to a SMART center prior to December 31, 2016. The breach, which occurred in September 2017, was an extortion attempt. Hackers gained access to SMART systems, allegedly stole data, and demanded a ransom payment to prevent the information from being released online.",
