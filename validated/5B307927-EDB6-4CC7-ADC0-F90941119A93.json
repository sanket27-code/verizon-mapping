  "summary": "It seems that this was nothing in comparison to a criminal issue that the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino was dealing with just down the road. News came out on Thursday that they had suffered a data breach courtesy of a criminal element. The casino made it known that their payment systems in their restaurant, bar and some retail locations had been compromised.  This sounds like a tune we've heard before. It sounds awfully similar to the data breaches that we have seen that affected the point of sale systems at Home Depot, Target and so forth. This time it seems that the data breach began on September 3rd, 2014 until it was discovered April 2nd, 2015. Seven months of transactions. Ouch. ",
