  "summary": "On April 22, 2013, Miles J. Slack of Clay County, West Virginia made a bad decision. Slack was going through a divorce at the time and had grown concerned about his wife's relationship with an \"unnamed individual.\" So he entered his wife's workplace after normal business hours, located her PC, and installed a tiny keylogger between her keyboard cable and her computer. The keylogger would record his wife's e-mails and her instant messaging chats as she typed them out letter by letter, along with the usernames and passwords she used for various online services. Slack left the office without getting caught.",
