  "summary": "A provider informed the Privacy Officer (PO) that a form that he completed for a Veteran had disappeared. He had hand carried it to the Release of Information (ROI) department and they were not there, so he left it with the Eligibility Supervisor. She handed it to one of the clerical staff. Neither the Supervisor nor the clerk can find the paperwork. The Veteran was asked to bring in another form so the provider can fill it out. The PO is trying to reach the Veteran to get more information on what exactly patient information was on the form. It did include the name, date of birth and full SSN.",
