  "summary": "  A mailer sent to some Orlando voters features Mayor Buddy Dyer standing with a group of children, stating a vote for him will \u201chelp Orlando reach new heights.\u201d  But what prompted concerns from some was on the backside: A request form for a vote-by-mail ballot, with the voter\u2019s name, address, phone number and date of birth pre-filled out. The form also already had adhesive to seal it and a crease to fold and mail the form in.  After receiving complaints on Facebook about the information being displayed, the campaign said Tuesday it would limit the personal information it uses going forward.  \u201cThis common practice to help increase participation has raised privacy concerns with some residents,\u201d said Jessica Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Dyer campaign. \u201cDue to this feedback, we will limit the information we pre-fill in our outreach.\u201d",
