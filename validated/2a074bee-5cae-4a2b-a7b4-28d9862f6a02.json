A Mandiant investigation determined an \u201cunauthorized actor gained access to Magellan\u2019s systems after sending a phishing email on April 6\u201d impersonating one of the company\u2019s clients, the company said in a notice from Magellan Senior Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer John J. DiBernardi. Before launching ransomware the third party \u201cexfiltrated a subset of data\u201d from one of Magellan\u2019s corporate servers that contained customer PII, including names, addresses, employee ID numbers and W-2 or 1099 details such as Social Security numbers or Taxpayer ID numbers. \u201cIn limited instances, and only with respect to certain current employees, the unauthorized actor also used a piece of malware designed to steal login credentials and passwords.\u201d ",
