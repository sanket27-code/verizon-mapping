  "summary": "California's Kearny Mesa Infiniti recently began informing an undisclosed number of customers that their names, birthdates, addresses, phone numbers, Social Security numbers and driver's license information may have been improperly accessed by a former employee.  According to the notification letter [PDF], a Kearny Mesa Infiniti customer has alleged that the former employee used that customer's personal information to obtain prescription drugs.  \"Based on our internal review and the private nature of the information that may have been improperly accessed, we are notifying any individual who provided us with their personal information during the accused individual's employment,\" Kearny Mesa Infiniti wrote in the notification letter.  While there's no indication that other customers' personal data was improperly accessed, the auto dealer is advising all those affected to consider placing a fraud alert on their credit files.",
