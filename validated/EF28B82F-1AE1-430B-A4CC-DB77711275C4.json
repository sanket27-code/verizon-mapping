  "summary": "Middle England will be shocked to discover that the Daily Mail's website, the world's most read online newspaper, has only gone and admitted to a shameful data security cock-up.  The publication - which is known for displaying loads of pictures of tits and ass online normally alongside an equal amount of outrage about tits and ass online - has alerted world+dog that there was an \"URGENT problem\" with its users' profiles.  Last night we had a technical issue with our user profile and login service that resulted in a bug with the display of user profiles. When viewing your profile page users were presented with a copy of another user's profile page instead of their own. The issue is now resolved.",
