  "summary": "A laptop holding the records of eight million patients has gone missing from an NHS store room, reports Mike Sullivan in The Sun newspaper.  According to the report, the laptop was one of 20 that disappeared from offices of the North Central London Strategic Health Authority. The room was being used by London Health Programmes, a medical research organisation. The Programmehas confirmed the loss of the laptop and the data it contained.  The computers went missing three weeks ago but the theft has only just been reported to the police, Sullivan claimed. The unencrypted records held details of 8.63 million patients and 18 million hospital visits, procedures and operations.  London Health Programmes evolved from the work of the Healthcare for London programme and NHS Commissioning Support for London (CSL) and develops proposals to improve health and healthcare services for Londoners. The organisation is currently reviewing care procedures for a variety of health issues, including cancer, tuberculosis, mental health and burns.   Statements from the programme, however, indicate the laptop was used for statistical analysis, and was somehow missed from the organisations policy of wiping data. Although password-protected, it was not encrypted.",
