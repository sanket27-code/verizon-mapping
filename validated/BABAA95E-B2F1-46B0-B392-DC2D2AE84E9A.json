  "summary": "The RCMP is accused of violating the privacy of several of its members by handing over their personal medical records in a dispute with a B.C. psychologist.  The Mounted Police Professional Association of Canada filed a complaint today asking the federal privacy commissioner to investigate.  The association claims the information was disclosed to B.C.\u2019s College of Psychologists without consent in order to bolster the force\u2019s complaint against psychologist Michael Webster, an outspoken critic of the organization.  Association president Rae Banwarie says the disclosure shows a \u201ccrass and cynical disregard\u201d for RCMP member\u2019s privacy and most sensitive personal health information.  The RCMP filed the complaint against Webster last August, saying his advocacy for change within the organization was detrimental to the treatment of his police officer patients.  The college found that the complaint against Webster was unfounded.",
