  "summary": "Digital banking app and tech unicorn Dave.com confirmed today a security breach after a hacker published the details of 7,516,625 users on a public forum.  In an email to ZDNet today, Dave said the security breach originated on the network of a former business partner, Waydev, an analytics platform used by engineering teams.  \"As the result of a breach at Waydev, one of Dave's former third party service providers, a malicious party recently gained unauthorized access to certain user data at Dave,\" a spokesperson told ZDNet.  The company said it has already plugged the hacker's point of entry and is in the process of notifying customers of the incident. Dave app passwords are also being reset after being exposed.  \"As soon as Dave became aware of this incident, the company immediately initiated an investigation, which is ongoing, and is coordinating with law enforcement, including with the FBI around claims by a malicious party that it has 'cracked' some of these passwords and is attempting to sell Dave customer data,\" Dave said.  The company also brought in cyber-security firm CrowdStrike to assist the investigation.",
