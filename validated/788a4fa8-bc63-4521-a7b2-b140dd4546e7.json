  "summary": "A former software engineer named Paige A. Thompson hacked into Capital One's systems and accessed the information of more than 100 million credit-card applicants and customers, federal prosecutors said. An FBI agent said he tracked her down after she talked about it online.  A software engineer in Seattle was behind a Capital One data breach that affected more than 100 million credit-card applicants and customers in the US and Canada, prosecutors alleged in a criminal complaint on Monday.  Paige A. Thompson, a former Amazon employee, was arrested by the FBI in Seattle and appeared in court on Monday. She was charged with a single count of computer fraud and abuse. If convicted, she could face a sentence of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.   The breach occurred on March 22 and 23, the complaint said. Capital One, the fifth-largest credit-card issuer in the US, said the largest category of compromised information involved consumers and small businesses that applied for credit cards between 2005 and early 2019.  In the complaint, an FBI agent, Joel Martini, laid out evidence he found on GitHub, Slack, Meetup, and Twitter.  The complaint, filed with the US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, said Thompson posted on GitHub on April 21 about the leaked information.  The post, dubbed the \"April 21 File,\" contained \"a list of more than 700 folders or buckets of data,\" as well as code for three commands to obtain Capital One's credentials and extract data, the complaint said.
