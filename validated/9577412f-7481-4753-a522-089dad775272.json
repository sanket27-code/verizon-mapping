  "summary": "It was an incredible email mix-up that gave a Canadian theatre critic a rugby league scoop. But when James Kelly Nestruck posted on social media about an email sent to him instead of Manly Sea Eagles chief executive Joe Kelly, eagles of the legal variety swooped.  The unlikely turn of events \u2013 which resulted in Wests Tigers forward Martin Taupau's new four-year contract at Manly being made public \u2013 has highlighted the legal risks in forwarding confidential emails sent in error. It has also pointed to the limitations in Australian laws protecting privacy and confidential information.",
