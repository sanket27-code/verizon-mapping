Shannen Doherty's lawsuit against her former business management firm was stunning enough for the revelation that the Beverly Hills, 90210 star has breast cancer, but in a new explosive legal filing, the actress discusses an employee at the firm who impersonated her for the alleged purpose of obtaining access to confidential medical information.
