  "summary": "Initially four hard drives sold eBay in October and November 2010 were found to contain were found to contain sensitive personal data of both patients and staff. Despite the Trust's assurance that these were the only drives lost, further hard drives were recovered by the ICO after being sold on eBay. The Trust was unable to explain how an unnamed individual, who was sub-contracted by a sub-contractor to the IT supplier to the Trust to destroy the 1,000 hard drives, managed to remove at least 252 of the 1,000 hard drives he was supposed to be destroying from the hospital during his five days on the premises. Despite the security precautions taken there were insufficient records taken to provide a reliable audit trail of which hard drives were and were not destroyed.  The Information Commissioner (ICO) ended up imposing a fine of 325,000 after sensitive patient  data of thousands of people was discovered on hard drives sold on eBay.  An investigation found that at least 232 de-commissioned drives that should have been deep cleaned and destroyed by a contractor ended up being sold second hand.",
