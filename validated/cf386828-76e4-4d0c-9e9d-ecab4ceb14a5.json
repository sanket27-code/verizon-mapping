  "summary": "India\u2019s largest cell network Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance, launched its coronavirus self-test symptom checker in late March, just before the Indian government imposed a strict nationwide lockdown to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. The symptom checker allows anyone to check their symptoms from their phone or Jio\u2019s website to see if they may have become infected with COVID-19.  But a security lapse exposed one of the symptom checker\u2019s core databases to the internet without a password, TechCrunch has found.",
