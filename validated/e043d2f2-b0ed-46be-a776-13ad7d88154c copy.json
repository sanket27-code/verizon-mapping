During the investigation conducted with the help of third-party data privacy and computer forensics specialists, Entercom discovered that the attacker was able to gain access to the names, usernames, and passwords of the impacted Radio.com users.  We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause you. We remain committed to safeguarding the information in our care and will continue to take steps to ensure the security of our systems. - Radio.com Customer Support Team  Following the data breach, the radio giant implemented several measures designed to prevent similar incidents in the future, including but not limited to passwords rotations, cloud services multifactor authentication and stronger password policies, and staff data security training.
