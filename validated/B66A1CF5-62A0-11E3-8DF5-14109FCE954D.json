  "summary": "A nurse left two surgery schedules with labels and wrist bands turned upside down on her desk. When she returned from lunch, everything was missing. The Privacy Officer (PO) asked each of the 3 staff who were at the nursing station (while the other nurse was at lunch) if they knew what happened to the information.  All responded that they saw no one take the information. The shred bin was also checked and the information was not in it. It is suspected that one of the employee's took the information to prove a point.",
