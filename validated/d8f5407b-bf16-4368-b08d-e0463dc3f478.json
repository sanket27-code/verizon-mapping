The large file was found near bushes at the Bernard McGlinchey Park near the Letterkenny University Hospital files containing sensitive medical history about an elderly woman and 32 other patients.  In addition to letters to the family doctor, the file also contains parts of her medical history.  How the file got into the park is not yet known.  Councilor Gerry McMonagle, a member of the Northwest Regional Health Forum, has called for a full investigation.",
