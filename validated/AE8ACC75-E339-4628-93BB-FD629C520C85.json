The employee's agency concluded its investigation in 2006, and the subject received a one-year letter of reprimand (prohibiting promotions, awards and within-grade increases) and a 10 day suspension without pay.  The subject's pending permanent-change-of-station assignment was cancelled, and his promotion recommendation was withdrawn.",
