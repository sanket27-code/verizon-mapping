  "summary": "Boston-based ride-hailing hopeful Fasten has coughed to a million-customer data breach that happened because someone left a database lying around unsecured.  The breach was turned up by cloud-crowd Kromtech, whose Bob Diachenko wrote late last week that the company had a misconfigured Apache Hive database exposed on the Internet. Hive is a data warehouse system built on top of Hadoop.  \u201cThe server was left open for end-user access and this also let anyone with an internet connection access Fasten\u2019s internal data\u201d, he wrote.  The exposed customer data included names, e-mails, telephone numbers, IMEI codes, trip details (pick-up and drop-off points), and links to photos. Corporate data, including a few thousand driver profiles, routes, comments about drivers, car registration, and photos of drivers\u2019 vehicles.",
