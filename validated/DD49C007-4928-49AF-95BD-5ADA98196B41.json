  "summary": "An Office of Civil Rights (OCR) complaint was submitted by a former employee/patient of NMVAHCS regarding unauthorized and inappropriate access to medical records. The former employee alleged that a former coworker accessed his medical record without a need and used the information to discriminate against him. \nDuring the investigation the former coworker states that she did access the former employee's medical records because he \"asked for my assistance several times \nwhile he was here. Since he was an employee here at that time I would not have gone into his chart without his permission with him present.\" Because he was an \nemployee of NMVAHCS at the time and not receiving treatment from this NMVAHCS provider, this is a violation of the local privacy and security policies in place at \nNMVAHCS.\nIncident Update\n08/01/11:\nThe former employee will be sent a letter offering credit protection services, due to full name and full SSN being accessed without authorization.",
