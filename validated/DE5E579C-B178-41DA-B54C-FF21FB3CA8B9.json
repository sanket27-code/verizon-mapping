  "summary": "  Anonymous hackers have defaced the official website of Spains Peoples Party (Partido Popular), the countrys governing party.  In addition to defacing the website  which has been restored , the hacktivists have also leaked 5 gigabytes of documents that allegedly represent the partys financial accounts from 1990 to 2011.  Darknet.in reports that the party refused to release the documents after a judge overseeing a political corruption scandal asked to see them.  The information has been posted on torrent sites, blogs and other websites so that citizens can analyze it.  According to a video statement published by the hackers a couple of days ago, the documents show that the Peoples Party has used public money to buy expensive cars, a pony and other items.  The hacktivists are displeased with the fact that the party keeps talking about austerity and cuts while it robs the people. ",
