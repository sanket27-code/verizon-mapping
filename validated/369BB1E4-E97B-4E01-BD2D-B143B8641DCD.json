The records were discovered by a man on a sidewalk with some other trash in the area of Paradise Valley Road and Jester Street. The man then reported it to San Diego police. The records, belonging to Chula Vista-based Modern Home Health Care, had names, addresses, birthdays and Social Security numbers.    Modern Home provides health care services to patients in their homes.    The company told 10News it is looking into how the documents got left on the sidewalk. A representative said Modern Home hires another company to shred all its documents. ",
