  "summary": "It was alleged that the ex-wife   a combined laboratory and x-ray technologist in the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region  snooped into the records of the ex-husband and their daughter and also tested the daughter's urine.  However, with respect to the urine, there were no records created, nor data entered into the health region's computer system, so it's not a privacy issue, commissioner Ron Kruzeniski ruled April 5.  For that reason, Kruzeniski said the urine case is a worker conduct or misconduct issue.  Meanwhile, accessing the documents was ruled a breach of the Health Information Protection Act.  Between 2012 and 2014, in five cases, the employee accessed medical data from the system that contains x-rays, CT scans and MRI scans.  Two cases involved her ex-husband's information, while three involved her daughter's.",
