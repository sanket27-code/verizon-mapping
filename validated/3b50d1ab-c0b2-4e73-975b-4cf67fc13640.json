Florida Blue says \u201cless than 1 percent\u201d of its approximately 5 million members were affected.  The breach, which reportedly occurred on May 28, was traced back to an employee who handles the healthcare provider\u2019s member data. Magellan believes the employee\u2019s email was hacked in a phishing scam. In doing so, numerous personal identifiers including the members\u2019 names, dates of birth and prescriptions might\u2019ve been accessed.The private information of nearly 44,000 TennCare members may have been stolen by a hacker who breached the email system of the agency\u2019s pharmacy management vendor, officials announced on Friday.  The private information that was potentially compromised includes names, social security numbers, member IDs, health plans, provider names and the names of drugs members have been prescribed.",
