  "summary": "Houston mayoral candidate and prominent trial lawyer Tony Buzbee is serving as defense counsel in a federal court lawsuit in Pennsylvania, brought by a health care provider who says the owner and operator of its computerized records database illegally procured and retained its confidential patient data. Meanwhile, Buzbee's client counters that it is the party that is victim to theft.  Post Acute Medical, LLC of Enola filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on July 2 versus Christopher LeBlanc and Meridian Hospital Systems Corporation of Dallas, Texas.  \u201cUntil recently, PAM had authorized Meridian and LeBlanc to access PAM\u2019s confidential patient data and business information in connection with PAM\u2019s daily operations, because Meridian set up a computerized database through certain software applications, to essentially house and aggregate PAM\u2019s data,\u201d the suit reads.  \u201cImportantly, this highly confidential data included Protected Health Information and Electronic Protected Health Information related to patients in PAM\u2019s network affiliated hospitals throughout the country, as well as valuable customer and vendor contact lists and preference information, which PAM does not disclose to the public.\u201d  Meridian allegedly understood and agreed it had no authorization to use PAM\u2019s confidential data for any reason other than supporting PAM\u2019s operations and would return it at the end of the contract, per HIPAA regulations and made clear through a one year-long written addendum agreement entered into in June 2018.  \u201cThroughout the entirety of the relationship, PAM repeatedly reported several frustrations to LeBlanc about the effectiveness of Meridian\u2019s software applications, which ultimately led PAM to the realization that it would be better for PAM\u2019s operations to develop its own applications tailored to its specific and evolving needs,\u201d the suit states.  At one point, the suit says discussions centered on PAM acquiring an equity interest in Meridian, if PAM would stay with Meridian and enter into a long-term contract, but negotiations later fell through. Subsequently, the defendants were charged with having committed the following:  \u2022 Falsely accusing PAM of misappropriating its software applications;  \u2022 Abruptly terminating PAM\u2019s access to Meridian\u2019s applications and PAM\u2019s own highly confidential data; \u2022 Repeatedly refusing to return PAM\u2019s highly confidential data;  \u2022 Accessing and mining PAM\u2019s highly confidential data without authorization after receiving multiple demands from PAM to immediately return such data; and  \u2022 Publicly disclosing protected health information of a patient, which was contained in PAM\u2019s highly confidential data that Meridian was not authorized to access, and has been holding hostage since May of 2019.  \u201cAlthough LeBlanc and Meridian received more than a half-dozen requests from PAM to immediately return PAM\u2019s highly confidential data, rather than return any such data as required by law, LeBlanc and Meridian have held the data ransom and repeatedly threatened to destroy it in violation of HIPAA,\u201d according to the lawsuit.  The Pennsylvania suit further alleges that in an attempt to delay returning PAM\u2019s confidential and proprietary records, the defendants separately filed a \u201cgroundless\u201d lawsuit in Harris County, Texas District Court and a request for a temporary restraining order and injunction in Houston against PAM, Clear Lake Institute for Rehabilitation, LLC and Key Management Group, LLC, despite none of the case parties having any connection to that city.",
