  "summary": "A Vancouver medical imaging center inadvertently disclosed the names of more than 600 patients when mailing appointment reminders.  On Dec. 30, Vancouver Radiologists mailed 603 mammogram appointment reminder postcards to its patients. On Jan. 4, the company discovered an error was made while preparing the mailing labels.  The postcards were mailed to patients at their addresses but with another patient's name on the label. The postcards included the incorrect patient name, the name of Vancouver Radiologists and a reminder that it was time to schedule an annual mammogram.  The postcards did not include any other identifying information.  Vancouver Radiologists is notifying patients affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act breach, in compliance with state and federal law.  Vancouver Radiologists has investigated how the error occurred and suspended the mammogram appointment reminder postcards. The company is redesigning the process, implementing a written workflow and retraining its staff to prevent future HIPAA breaches.",
