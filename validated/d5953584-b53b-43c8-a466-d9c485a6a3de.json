  "summary": "Veterans Affairs Canada could be facing another lawsuit after a privacy breach involving 3,000 veterans who are part of the federal medical marijuana program.  Veterans began reporting the breach Friday that effectively outed them as medical marijuana users.  A VAC mailout informing patients about recent reimbursement changes lets anyone looking at the outside of the envelope know it was issued under the federal medical marijuana program.",
