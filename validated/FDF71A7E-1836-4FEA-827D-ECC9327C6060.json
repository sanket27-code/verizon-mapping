  "summary": "In 2009, a military unit at a foreign location notified the NSA OIG that, in 2009, a military member had queried a country's telephone numbers to aid in learning that country's language.  The misuse was discovered by a review of SIGINT audit logs.  The appropriate branch of the military determined that the analyst's queries were not in support of his official duties and violated USSID 18.",
