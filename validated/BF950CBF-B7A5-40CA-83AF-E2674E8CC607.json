  "summary": "A laptop containing the personal health information of 322 patients has been stolen from the office of a doctor working at a clinic at the Health Sciences Centre. The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority reported the incident this morning. It did not say which day the computer was stolen, only that the theft occurred \"recently.\" The laptop contained information on patient consultations within the last 18 months at the hepatology clinic within HSC. \"The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority takes patient privacy and its role in safeguarding personal health information seriously,\" said Real Cloutier, the WRHAs vice-president and chief operating officer. The WRHA has reported the incident to police. As well, the Manitoba Ombudsman has been notified of the potential privacy breach resulting from the theft. Letters to all affected patients notifying them and disclosing the incident have been issued by the regions privacy office. \"We can appreciate how unsettling this must be for patients,\" said. Cloutier. \"We are deeply sorry, and want to assure patients and the public we are looking at every option possible to get the laptop back.\"",
