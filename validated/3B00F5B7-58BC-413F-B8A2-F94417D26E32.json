  "summary": "A possible security breach within Sierra View District Hospitals network system was identified late Wednesday after the hospitals Information Technology Department observed unusual activity on the network. At this time we have no indication that patient information has been compromised, said Ramona Contreras, hospital spokesperson, on Friday. However, the hospital is working proactively to address and mitigate the issue. A specialized information security company was contacted Thursday, Contreras said, and will be aggressively trying to determine the depth of the breach and determine if patient information was effected. But, because of the companys internal approval process, there might be a delay. They may not be able to be on-site today as originally anticipated but may arrive within the next few days, Contreras said on Friday. Once we understand the scope of the breach, we will pursue further action based on the companys recommendations, Contreras said. Regulations indicate the hospital has five days to self-report once it is identified patient information has been compromised. Sierra View is taking a proactive stance and is in the process of notifying the state of the possible breach, Contreras said. Should it be confirmed that patient health information was compromised, the hospital is required to immediately notify patients that were effected.",
