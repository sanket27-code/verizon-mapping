  "summary": " Marin Community Clinics was able to resume use of its computer system Friday night after being hit by a ransomware attack between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. Wednesday.  \u201cWe\u2019re not totally out of the woods, but we\u2019re feeling good because we\u2019ve had the system up three days now.\u201d said Mitesh Popat, the clinics\u2019 CEO. \u201cThere is always reinfection risk hanging over your head. We\u2019re trying to play it super safe and super cautious.\u201d  Unidentified hackers somehow managed to encrypt the clinics\u2019 data and demanded a ransom to decrypt it. Typically, to be successful ransomware requires some form of user interaction, such as a user opening an attachment to an email and clicking on a malicious link.  Popat, however, said the ransomware used in the attack, known as Sodinokibi, gained access through a computer server.  \u201cIt was through our network operator,\u201d Popat said. He declined to identify the operator, citing security concerns.  Popat said Marin Community Clinics was able to resume use of its system fairly quickly because it backs up its data on a regular basis.",
