  "summary": "An attack on TU Berlin\u2019s Windows environment earlier today, 30 April 2021, has caused the University\u2019s system to go down. Encrypted files have thus far been identified. The impact of the attack remains unclear.  To prevent further damage, many systems, including the Exchange server, have been shut down and are currently unavailable for use. We are currently intensively working to limit the extent of the damage, identify the source, and implement measures for additional protection.  Please note: Users may experience restricted access to a number of services. Updates will be regularly provided here. Further action by TU members is not required. Please note that several systems, including the email server, tubCloud as well as the SAP applications, will remain unavailable during the weekend.",
