  "summary": "Cathay Pacific, one of the main airlines in Hong Kong, says records on as many as 9.4 million passengers may have been stolen in a data breach.  The airline said in a statement Wednesday that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that passenger data had been misused, but warned that passenger names, dates of birth, nationalities, phone numbers, email and postal addresses, and passport and identity card numbers may have been taken. Historical travel information and remarks made by customer service was also accessed.  A little over 400 expired credit card numbers were accessed, including 27 credit card numbers without verification numbers.  No passwords were taken in the breach, the company said.  The company said that it first identified unauthorized access to its systems in March, but didn\u2019t say why it took more than six months to reveal the breach publicly. The company didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours. That might be a problem for the company in Europe, where the recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now requires organizations to notify the authorities and customers of a breach within three days. Companies flouting the law can face fines of up to four percent of their global annual revenue.  ",
