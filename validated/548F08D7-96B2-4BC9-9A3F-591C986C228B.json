  "summary": "Data about 16 child patients at the Royal Oldham Hospital was found more than 40 miles away in Liverpool.  The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said any loss of data was unacceptable.  A spokesman told Capital: \"We take incidents involving patient data very seriously.  \"We have clear systems in place to ensure the confidentiality of patient data and this information would normally only be handled by a small number of doctors and nurses on the Childrens ward.  \"We will now undertake a full investigation into how this document ended up in Liverpool.  \"As part of this investigation, we will find out what went wrong in this case. We will also be contacting the parents and guardians of all the sixteen patients involved.\"  At the same time bosses at the Royal Bolton Hospital are investigating after medical notes were found in Bolton on Good Friday.  They are reported to have contained the details of 25 patients.  In a statement Bolton's NHS Foundation Trust said it was extremely concerned by the discovery.  \"We take all confidentiality issues very seriously. Managing patient information legally, securely and efficiently is of paramount importance to the Trust.  \"We have spoken directly to the patients concerned and apologised to patients and carers.  \"An investigation panel is now being convened to carry out a full investigation.\"",
