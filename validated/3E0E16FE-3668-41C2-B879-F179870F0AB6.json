  "summary": "A hacker that uses the online moniker Ag3nt47 claims to have breached the Atlanta Chapter of the US Federal Bar Association (fedbaratlanta.org).  The hacker has published several user records allegedly stolen from the website\u2019s databases. The leaked data includes administrator names, usernames and passwords.  In addition, Ag3nt47 has posted on Pastebin the names, addresses, email addresses, passwords, and other contact information of around 85 individuals.  I can\u2019t confirm if the leaked data genuinely comes from the systems of Atlanta Chapter of the US Federal Bar Association (FBA). However, many of the names from the file published by the hacker do match the ones of FBA members.  I\u2019ve reached out to the organization in hopes that it can provide more details.  I\u2019ll update this post if it responds.",
