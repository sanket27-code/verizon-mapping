  "summary": "The NHS is blaming a coding error for 150,000 patients in England being involved in a data breach. Those affected had requested that their confidential health information only be used to help provide them with care. But it appears that there was a problem with the software used by GPs to record objections to the same data being used for research and auditing purposes. As a result, the SystmOne application involved never passed on the request to NHS England's IT provider. The software's developer TPP has said it \"apologises unreservedly\" for the fault.",
