AIB in Adare and Raheen as well as PTSB banks in St Nessans Road Dooradoyle and William Street are understood to be locations where the card PIN numbers were obtained.

Further reports have emerged regarding other suspicious transactions appearing on customer accounts from as far as Thailand and Eastern Europe, but these have not been confirmed and are being investigated by the banks.
