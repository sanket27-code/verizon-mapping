It identified more than 30 vulnerable children.  The document names all the children, some who are siblings, and has an itemised description of the claims, which include DNA testing, psychological assessments and medical appointments.  It also lists their Client Relationship Information System numbers, the workers involved in the case and the names of the organisations providing services, such as child care agencies.",
