  "summary": "More than 100,000 customers' personal information were found to have leaked from major credit card firms in yet another case in a string of data theft, financial authorities said Friday. The discovery was made during an investigation of a group of hackers that had penetrated the storage server of a point-of-sale (POS) company and stole 3.2 million pieces of credit card usage records. A POS device, which includes a debit and credit card reader, collects user names, contacts, credit card numbers and other confidential information for transactions in money and goods.",
