  "summary": "Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., on Friday revealed it had a breach of patient and donor information last fall.  In a notice posted to its website, the organization revealed that it found \u201cunusual\u201d activity on its networks on Sept. 3. At that time, it began securing its systems, started an investigation and notified law enforcement.  \u201cNothing is more important to us than our patients\u2019 privacy,\u201d the notice said. \u201cWe have extensive security measures in place, and we continuously take steps to enhance the security of our systems and the data entrusted to us. We will also continue to assist law enforcement\u2019s efforts to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of this incident.\u201d  On Oct. 21, the investigation determined that \u201cunauthorized actors gained access to [the] network.\u201d It also revealed that the data breach, which occurred from Aug. 27 to Oct. 8, impacted only the D.C. branch. PPMW indicated that confidential data was breached during the incident when the hackers acquired copies of documents that contained patient information. Leaked information included names, addresses, dates of birth, diagnoses, treatments and prescription information. Social Security and financial information was also included in the breach. Joshua Speiser, director of communications for PPMW, said the breach affected a limited number of its patients but did not provide a more specific figure.  The notice did not mention that donors were compromised in the breach but those affected also received letters. Check images with a donor\u2019s name, bank account number and routing number were among the documents included in the leak.  On April 9, PPMW began mailing letters to affected patients about whom they could reach for guidance on further protecting their information. The findings of the investigation found \u201cno reason to suspect that there has been any fraudulent use of patient information associated with this incident.\u201d However, the organization is providing patients whose Social Security and driver\u2019s license numbers were compromised with complimentary credit monitoring and identity-theft protection services. Donors with compromised bank information did not receive the same service offer.  The organization has been working with law enforcement to continue investigating who committed the breach, but Speiser said they have \u201cno indication PPMW was specifically targeted because of the work we do.\u201d",
