  "summary": "Police have charged a Rahway woman, who allegedly stole personal information about residents from her employer, with credit card fraud and theft.  Detective Robert Harms arrested Jennifer De Los Santos, 23, on March 14 at a healthcare facility in Linden where she worked as a patient service supervisor, after he identified her as a suspect in an investigation of credit card fraud, police said.  The investigation began when Roselle Park Police were alerted that a residents credit card account information had been compromised after a telephone billing transaction with the healthcare facility.  The theft/fraud suspect, later identified as De Los Santos, allegedly used the patients credit card information to purchase merchandise online from Forever 21, Diapers.com and Target. De Los Santos had the companies ship the merchandise to the healthcare facility using a fictitious name, police said.  While interviewing De Los Santos, police became aware of an additional fraudulent credit card transaction involving a Roselle Park patient of the facility. Police charged De Los Santos with that incident as well.  With the assistance of her employer, police discovered several other incidents of credit card fraud involving De Los Santos, which were then referred to the Linden Police for further investigation.  Roselle Park police charged De Los Santos with two counts fraudulent use of a credit card and two counts of theft. She was later released pending an appearance in the Union County Superior Court.",
