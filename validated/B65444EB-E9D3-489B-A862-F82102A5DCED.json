  "summary": "Navy veteran Sylvester Woodland said he couldnt believe what he was seeing Wednesday night when he logged onto the Veteran Affairs E-Benefits website.  It gave me a different persons name, each and every time I came back, Woodland said. At first I thought it was just a glitch, but the more I thought about it, I said, wait a minute, this is more than a glitch, this is a breach.  Woodland was on the VAs E-Benefits website trying to track down his own history for a bank loan. Instead, windows kept popping up displaying other veterans medical and financial information.  When you click on these hyperlinks here, it takes you to the bank account, the direct deposit, bank account, last four, what bank is it for, Woodland said. Ill bet he has no idea that Im sitting here in my house with his information.",
