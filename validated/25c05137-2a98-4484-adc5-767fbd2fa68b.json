  "summary": "A doctor who works at an Orchard Park pain management clinic has been arrested and charged by criminal complaint with obtaining controlled substances through fraud and identity theft.  The prescriptions were for opioids including hydromorphone HCL, fentanyl citrate, and morphine sulfate. Two of the 23 patients for whom defendant wrote the prescriptions were already deceased at the time. Biddle wrote a combined total of 33 separate controlled substance prescriptions for them.  According to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, evidence obtained from Dr. Biddle\u2019s trash suggest that the opioids he was fraudulently receiving were being used unlawfully at his home, as well as marijuana.",
