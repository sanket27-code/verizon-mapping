The following day Aramco announced that none of the infected computers were part of the network directly tied to oil production, and that the company would soon resume full operations. The virus hit companies within the oil and energy sectors.  Due to this attack, the main site of Aramco went down and a message came to the home page apologizing to customers. Computer security specialists said that \"The attack, known as Shamoon, is said to have hit \"at least one organization\" in the sector. Shamoon is capable of wiping files and rendering several computers on a network unusable.\"",
