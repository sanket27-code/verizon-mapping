  "summary": "Verizon Wireless has reportedly fired several employees for accessing the cell phone records of President-elect Barack Obama. The mobile provider got rid of an undisclosed number of workers after they gained unauthorized access to a now inactive account used by Obama, according to CNN.com. \"We don't have anything to add from our statement of last Thursday,\" a Verizon spokesman said in an e-mail. \"Wouldn't deny (nor confirm) what CNN has reported, though.\" Verizon announced Thursday that employees had accessed an Obama account tied to a flip-phone, not a PDA like the BlackBerry. \"All employees who have accessed the account - whether authorized or not - have been put on immediate leave, with pay,\" Verizon said at the time. \"As the circumstances of each individual employee's access to the account are determined, the company will take appropriate actions.\" Employees found to have accessed Obama's account for legitimate reasons will be reinstated while those who did so without cause will \"face appropriate disciplinary action,\" Verizon said. While on the campaign trail, Obama has been spotted with a BlackBerry, a Motorola RAZR flip phone, and an iPhone, among other devices.",
