Gerard Power, director of public and corporate communications for the Toronto hospital, said in an emailed statement to the Star Wednesday night that an investigation had shown that inappropriate access of his medical record was obtained by certain individuals. It is unclear when this breach of privacy took place. Power said the hospitals president and CEO, Rueben Devlin, let the mayor know earlier in the day Wednesday that his health records had been wrongly accessed.",
