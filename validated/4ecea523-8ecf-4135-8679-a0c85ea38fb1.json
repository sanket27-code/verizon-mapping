  "summary": "BOCA RATON, FL (BocaNewsNow.com) \u2014 The Palm Beach County School District is in the midst of a massive computer security crisis that draws into question the authenticity of every assignment completed by every student since \u201cdistance learning\u201d began, after BocaNewsNow.com learned that an elementary school student hacked the school district\u2019s password system.  Exclusive We are not revealing the password convention that is used in the school district, but the second grader\u2019s \u2014 you are reading that correctly, the second grader\u2019s \u2014 hacking resulted in an emergency login change for \u201clive\u201d morning meetings in several elementary schools last week. It did not result \u2014 yet \u2014 in a district-wide reassignment of student passwords for the School District\u2019s \u201cPortal\u201d which provides access to Google Classroom.  It is unclear if teachers and administrators were aware that the second grader\u2019s hack potentially impacted the entire 176,000 student school district.  Every Palm Beach County School District student is now utilizing \u201cGoogle Classroom\u201d during \u201cdistance learning.\u201d The system is used for email, classroom work assignments, live communication with teachers, and tests. The hack potentially lets any student log into any other student\u2019s Google Classroom account.  Monday, a 10-year-old proved to BocaNewsNow.com that he was able to log into an unrelated 6-year-old\u2019s account with the permission of that student\u2019s parent. The 10-year-old was given nothing but the name of the student in another grade. That 10-year-old \u2014 using the hack widely shared among students \u2014 needed less than two minutes to find the 6-year-old\u2019s account and enough identifying information to log in as the 6-year-old.  All of the identifying information was located on the Palm Beach County School District\u2019s computer network.  Once logged in, the 10-year-old had complete access to the 6-year-old\u2019s school work, teacher emails, \u201cchats,\u201d and classroom \u201clive video stream.\u201d  BocaNewsNow.com alerted the Palm Beach County School District\u2019s media relations department of the hack at 6:45 p.m. Monday and promised that this story would not publish until 7 a.m. Tuesday, giving the District ample time to force mandatory password changes District-wide. A Spokesperson said that the information was being forwarded \u2014 immediately \u2014 to the District\u2019s I.T. Department.  At 8:30 p.m., a School District representative told BocaNewsNow.com that students are instructed to change their password regularly, but students and teachers told BocaNewsNow.com that this is NOT permitted \u2014 at least at the elementary level.  Later Monday evening, the School District confirmed that elementary school students are not permitted to change their passwords. A spokesperson said that may change this week as a result of the massive password compromise.  Google Classroom is \u2014 at its core \u2014 an education version of professional \u201cGSuite\u201c which is used by major companies worldwide. The security protocols available under professional \u201cGSuite\u201d accounts, however, are not accessible at the student level for users of Google Classroom. A password switch has to be initiated \u2014 and approved \u2014 by the Palm Beach County School District \u2014 at least for students in elementary school. That leaves all elementary school accounts \u2014 as well as every account where students haven\u2019t changed passwords on their own \u2014 accessible.  The flaw isn\u2019t Google\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s the School District\u2019s. Students use their School District \u201cPortal\u201d login information to access Google Classroom.  Before March, Palm Beach County School District students primary used Google Classroom in the presence of a teacher \u2014 there was no reason to access the system remotely. Distance learning, however, made it the center of online schooling. The School District\u2019s I.T. department apparently never imagined that its simple default password naming convention could impact the accuracy, authenticity and online safety of every student in the Palm Beach County School District.",
