  "summary": "The South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio has experienced a data breach affecting approximately 4,000 veterans, according to a KSAT report.  The VA was mailing out letters to veterans regarding the new hydrocodone combination federal rule, but the letters were accidently printed double-sided, displaying the information of one patient on one side of the page and the information of another patient on the other side of the page, according to the report.  Compromised information in the letters included full names, addresses and disclosure if the patient currently has a prescription for a narcotic, according to the report.  Marie Weldon, director of the medical center, said in the report \"immediate actions are being taken\" to inform veterans who may be affected by the error.",
