  "summary": "Equifax last week disclosed a historic breach involving Social Security numbers and other sensitive data on as many as 143 million Americans. The company said the breach also impacted an undisclosed number of people in Canada and the United Kingdom. The Equifax hack exposed customer names, birthdates, addresses, driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers and more. The breach was originally reported on Sept. 7, though three Equifax executives sold nearly $2 million of the company's stock just a few days after the company found out about the hack on July 29. ",
