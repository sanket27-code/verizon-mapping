  "summary": "TERRITORY Health Department insiders have aired claims of endemic bullying at the hands of departmental managers they say are shielded by a culture of intimidation.  One manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he had never seen anything like it in more than two decades in the industry, with the worst cases at remote clinics.  Its absolutely shocking, just shocking, out of control he said. Its the same people over and over again.  The reactions were sparked after Health Minister Robyn Lambley announced a new strategy to combat inappropriate behaviour within the department this week, at the same time denying bullying was widespread.   She maintained the position yesterday.  The current Department of Health figures for reports of inappropriate workplace behaviour do not indicate that bullying and harassment is out of control, but I am determined to ensure that all ... employees can work in a safe and fair workplace, she said.  There have been 25 complaints of bullying from Department staff this financial year.  HAVE YOU BEEN BULLIED? TELL US IN THE COMMENT BOX BELOW  Of those, seven are still open and only two have been substantiated through investigations.  No managers have lost jobs.  The whole process of complaints is a waste of time, the source said.  There are a load of clinicians out bush who are too afraid to speak out or do anything.  He claimed managers subject to complaints were known to pick through clinical notes of the alleged victims for flaws in an attempt to strengthen their bargaining power and scare people from following through.  A former middle manager in the department, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said bullies would twist personal information and use it against people who dared speak up.  It is a long list (of tactics), she said.  And there is no-one to go to  it is a weak HR department ... basically they are protecting the bully and people dont speak out because they are afraid of being next on the list.  If you point out anything wrong, they come down on you ... thats when the bullying starts.  A statement from the Department yesterday urged anyone with complaints to speak to their line manager or human resources.  (The department) strongly disagrees with comments that bullying and harassment is out of control, it said.  Remote Health staff face many unique challenges and show some of the best leadership, dedication and cooperation within the department.",
