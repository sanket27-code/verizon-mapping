  "summary": "It is not uncommon for healthcare organizations to utilize offsite storage facilities. However, a standard, monthly rental storage unit may not necessarily be the best choice.  A woman purchased a storage unit in Henderson, Nevada that had been put up for sale due to non-payment. However, she discovered private medical records in boxes inside the unit, according to an 8 News NOW I-Team report.  The records were of patients who visited Seven Hills Radiology, which was run by Dr. Chinasa Egemonu. The diagnostic facility is no longer running, according to the news report. Moreover, the doctor in question is accused by some of being a fraud.  Radiologist Dr. Michael Baron told the investigative team that he read X-rays on a contract basis for Egemonu and is owed $40,000 from the Seven Hills doctor. Other late payments were also found in the storage locker.  The patient files are being turned over to state authorities, while federal officials are investigating to determine if patient privacy laws were violated.",
