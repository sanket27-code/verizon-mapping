  "summary": "A London gender identity clinic has mistakenly exposed details of close to 2,000 people on its email list.  The Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic sent patients an email about an art competition, with hundreds of others CC-ed in.  The clinic later tried to recall the message but the error had already been noticed.  The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which is responsible for the clinic, is investigating.  Two separate emails were sent, with about 900 people CC-ed on each.  One patient at the clinic, Jessie, told the BBC she was angry about what had happened.",
