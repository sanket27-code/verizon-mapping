The laptop was stolen from the home of a long-standing and trusted employee of the Nationwide who needed access to the data.  However, despite reporting the theft of the laptop promptly, he did not tell his employer what was on it and then went on holiday abroad.  It was only three weeks later that he told the building society that customer information had been lost, prompting its investigation.  \"The failure to manage or monitor downloads of very large amounts of data onto portable storage devices meant that Nationwide had limited control over information held in this way or how it was used, \" said the FSA.

The fine follows the theft of a laptop from a Nationwide employee's home which contained confidential customer data.  The Financial Services Authority (FSA) found security was not up to scratch after the man had put details of nearly 11 million customers on his computer.  The FSA also found that the Nationwide did not start an investigation until three weeks after the theft occurred. ",
