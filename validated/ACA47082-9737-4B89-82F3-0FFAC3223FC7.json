  "summary": "Drivers are being warned to be on their guard after two card reading devices were discovered on petrol pumps at a Sudbury supermarket.  Police were called to Tesco filling station in Springlands Way on Sunday at around 6.30pm after it was reported a skimming device had been found on one of the pay-at-pump petrol pumps.  On arrival officers also discovered a second card cloning device at another pump.  A spokeswoman for Suffolk Police said is was not known how long the card reading equipment had been on the pumps, and anyone who had used the pay-at-pump service should contact their bank to check for any unauthorised transactions.  She added that other cash points in the area may also have been tampered with by conmen.  Police are urging anyone using cashpoints or similar pay points to be vigilant and to alert staff or officers as quickly as possible if you spot anyone tampering with them or if you find anything suspicious, said the spokeswoman.
