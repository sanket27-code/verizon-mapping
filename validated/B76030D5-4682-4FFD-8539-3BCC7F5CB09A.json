  "summary": "Fidelity National Information Services, a financial processing company, said Tuesday a worker at one of its subsidiaries stole 2.3 million consumer records containing credit card, bank account and other personal information.  The employee sold the information to an unidentified data broker. The broker then sold it to several direct marketing companies, but the data was not used in identity theft or other fraudulent financial activity, officials from Fidelity subsidiary Certegy Check Services Inc. said in a conference call.  About 2.2 million records stolen from Certegy contained bank account information and 99,000 contained credit card information, company officials said.  As a result of this apparent theft, the consumers affected received marketing solicitations from the companies that bought the data, said Renz Nichols, president of St. Petersburg-based Certegy.",
