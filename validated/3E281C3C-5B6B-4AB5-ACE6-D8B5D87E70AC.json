  "summary": "An ex-employee of a hospice did not destroy protected health information as the law demands, resulting in a critical investigative news segment.  When Sandra Rambo found medical records while walking with her daughter at the side of a highway, she knew immediately that it violated patient healthcare protections. The pair found almost two dozen hard-copy documents from Amedisys, representing 17 different patients. Rambo called her local news station, WJHL, to discuss the documents  which included name and contact information; medical diagnoses and symptoms; and various other private patient details regarding hospice visits. The documents were from 2010.  A spokesperson for Amedisys, also interviewed by WJHL, said that a previous staff member hadnt destroyed the documents per the hospices policy. ",
