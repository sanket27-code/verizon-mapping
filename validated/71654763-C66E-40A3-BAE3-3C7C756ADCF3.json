  "summary": "Christopher Moore, the former Tax Administration Jamaica employee, who reportedly caused the Government to lose in excess of $1 billion in tax revenues, will again appear in the Corporate Area Resident Magistrates Court today.  Allegations are that, between October and December 2013, Moore gained access to the main taxing system for the Government from his home then manipulated the taxpayers revenue, causing the State to lose in excess of $1 billion.  Moore, 37, was employed at the East Street branch of the Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) as a computer technician when he reportedly committed the act.  Moore was arrested at his Portmore, St Catherine home during a pre-dawn operation by the Revenue Protection Division (RPD) and the Major Organised Crime and Anti-Corruption Task Force (MOCA) on June 20.  Several documents and computers with the names of individuals and companies were reportedly seized and Moore was subsequently charged with seven counts of unauthorised access to computer programme.  He was hit with three additional counts of unauthorised access to computer data and unauthorised interception of computer/ service following an appearance in court earlier this month.",
