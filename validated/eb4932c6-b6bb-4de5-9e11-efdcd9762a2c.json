An investigation and manual document review showed that an unauthorized third party accessed \u201ca limited number\u201d of MCW employee email accounts, and that they were compromised between July 21, 2017 and July 28, 2017. It could not be definitively concluded though whether patient PHI was actually accessed, viewed, downloaded or otherwise acquired.",
