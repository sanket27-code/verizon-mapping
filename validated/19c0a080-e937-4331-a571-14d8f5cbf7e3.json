And it was an inside job.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d said that patient, who 8News is not identifying. \u201cYou live in that fear, will my money be taken, will accounts be opened up in my name?\u201d  The news of the security breach came in a letter. It stated her \u201cclinical information, name, social security number, diagnosis and medications\u201d had been inappropriately accessed by an employee.  The letter also stated it had been going on for nearly two years. VCU became aware of it February 1. However, the letter dated March 21, didn\u2019t get to the patient until March 29. ",
