Using those instructions, the contract employee was able to reset a password, set answers to security questions and enter the account. The information contained in the eOPF was not his. Instead it applied to another employee (Employee B) with the same name and birth city. The contract employee said the file contained an Employee B's social security number, DOB and other sensitive information including employment paperwork.",
