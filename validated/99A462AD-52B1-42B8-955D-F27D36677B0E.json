  "summary": "Michael Schumacher's medical records may have been stolen during a burglary at his doctor's office, it is reported.  Confidential files pertaining to the condition of the stricken German Formula One legend may have been on a laptop belonging to Dr Johannes Peil.  His surgery in Bad Nauheim, Germany, has broken into last weekend by thieves who got in via a basement cellar.  If the report in the Mail is correct, it could spark fears of a repeat of a scandal last year in which Schumacher's medical records were offered for sale to media companies.  Schumacher's family threatened legal action if the documents found their way into the public domain. A helicopter medic was arrested in the investigation into the leak, only to be found hanged in his cell in Zurich, Switzerland.  Dr Peil is part of a team of medical experts caring for Schumacher as he recuperates from a ski crash in the French Alps in late 2013.  Recovery has been slow for the seven-time F1 champion, who emerged from a coma last June. It is understood he is partly conscious of his environment, but official updates have been scarce.",
