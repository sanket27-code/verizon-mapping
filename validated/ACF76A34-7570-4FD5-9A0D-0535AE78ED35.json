  "summary": "Arizona State University restored service at its online computer system Thursday night after shutting it down the day before because of a security breach.  On Wednesday evening, ASU students and employees were told in a security text alert that the university's ASURITE computer system may have been compromised and that all online services had been suspended.  This is the university's main online system, where students and employees log in with passwords and access classes and other services. There are more 300,000 accounts on the system.  ASU officials said an encrypted file containing user names and passwords was downloaded Wednesday by an unknown person outside the school. There is no evidence that any information was compromised, but all online services were shut down as a precaution.",
