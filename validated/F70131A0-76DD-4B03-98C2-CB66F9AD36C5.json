  "summary": "Dr. Cathrine Steinborn, DDS, is providing notice of a recent office theft which may affect the security of patient and responsible party personal and protected health information.  On January 5, 2015, Dr. Steinborns office was burglarized and a server containing patient and responsible party information was stolen. The burglary was immediately reported to Santa Clara Police Department. Since the burglary, Dr. Steinborns office has increased physical security and surveillance of the premises. The office has also encrypted patient and responsible party information, and enhanced physical security of the server on which this information is stored. Dr. Steinborn provided notice of this incident to affected individuals on January 9, 2015, January 13, 2015, and February 18, 2015. Dr. Steinborns investigation into this incident is ongoing. Information that may be contained in each valid record stored on the server includes name, address, date of birth, telephone number, Social Security number, dental and/or medical insurance information, health background information, treatment information, and billing information. The server did not contain bank account, drivers license, or credit/debit card information.  Although unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of the information stored on the server, Dr. Steinborn is offering each affected individual access to one free year of credit monitoring and identity restoration services. In addition to notifying affected patients and responsible parties about this incident, Dr. Steinborn is providing notice of this incident to certain federal and state regulators.",
