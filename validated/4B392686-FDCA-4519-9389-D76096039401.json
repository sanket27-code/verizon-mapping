  "summary": "A copy of patients' records, which include names, addresses, national insurance numbers and bank account details, has been lost by an optometrist in Strood.  The protected back-up copy of Niall O'Kane Optometrists' patient database was left on a train on Saturday, October 10.  Mr O'Kane wrote to patients explaining the situation. In the letter, he said: \"The data is protected by two layers of security, but does include your name, date of birth, address, contact details and eye examination records.  \"On a limited number of records, we also hold NI numbers. For those that pay or have paid by direct debit, the data loss will also include bank account details.\"  He advised customers to \"closely monitor\" their financial activity and be wary of unusual communications.  He added: \"We are currently conducting a review of our data security, and the procedures for backing up your electronic records, so the chances of such a loss of data can be minimised in the future.  \"My primary focus is to assist any patients who might be affected.  \"I take our patient privacy very seriously and this is no small issue for me.\"  Patients are advised to visit www.nokopt.com/data.php to keep up to date with their findings and to request a copy of their electronic records.",
