  "summary": "An Anonymous hacker that uses the online moniker Pr3-H4ck3r claims to have breached the official website of the Philippine Navy (navy.mil.ph).  As a result of the breach, around 50 email addresses, usernames and password, including administrator credentials, have been leaked online.  An SQL Injection vulnerability in the Navy\u2019s website gave him access to the user data, Pinoy Hack News informs.  The Philippine Navy website has been taken offline shortly after the hacker announced the attack.  This is not the first time when the Philippine Navy is hacked. Back in September 2012, a hacker group called LulzSec International breached the site and leaked around a dozen account login details.  Some of the data leaked by LulzSec matches the one published now by Pr3-H4ck3r.  Currently, the Philippine Navy website is still offline.",
