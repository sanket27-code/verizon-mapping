  "summary": "The Jewish General Hospital says it is taking very seriously a breach of patient confidentiality.  Hospital documents blew out of the back of a truck on Highway 15 near Mirabel yesterday.  One sheet of paper lodged on the windshield of a Laval woman who later retrieved it and was shocked to read the test results of a patient whose name, phone number and medicare number were listed.  When the Journal de Montreal called the number, it found out the patient had died in 2007.  The hospital says it doesn't understand how the breach happened. It says it does not throw out medical records that haven't been shredded and doesn't do business with the company whose name appeared on the truck.",
