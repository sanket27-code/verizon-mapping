  "summary": "Sprouts Farmers Market says it's been the victim of a security breach at more than dozen of their chains and customers in Arizona and California could be at risk.  \"The hackers used a very sophisticated mal ware to mimic our point of sale software,\" says Sprouts' spokeswoman Barbara McFadden.  Sprouts said it discovered that illegal software was able to pull credit card numbers at 19 of its 151 stores over a 5-day period between Jan. 25 and 29. The company was alerted to the problem by one of the local store managers who saw that the credit card terminals were going blank.",
