  "summary": "Privacy breaches involve former Waikato DHB staff member - Private and confidential documents outlining a hospital worker's breach of privacy and confidentiality against an inmate were found strewn across a Raglan lawn.  Intact letters outlining the alleged misconduct of a Waikato Hospital staff member on February 3, and witness reports of the incident, were put into a domestic rubbish bag and set on the kerb for collection. The rubbish bag was savaged by an animal, leaving the private and confidential documents in public view. A Raglan resident discovered them and rang the media.  One of the letters outlines the Waikato DHB's allegations against the female team leader, which include improperly using DHB records to look up information on her partner, who is in prison; an information privacy law specialist at Auckland University, said the documents should have been shredded before being discarded.",
