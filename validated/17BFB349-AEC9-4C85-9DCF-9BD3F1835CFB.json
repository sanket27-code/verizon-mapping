  "summary": "Over the weekend hackers penetrated two websites featuring discount programs for university students in Sweden. The hackers could have accessed information on nearly one million students through the Mercenat-card and CSN-card sites.  What information they actually accessed remains unclear.  In messages left on the homepages, the hackers wrote that they carried out the attack simply to demonstrate the sites weak security. They added that they didnt intend to use any of the information they had accessed. ",
