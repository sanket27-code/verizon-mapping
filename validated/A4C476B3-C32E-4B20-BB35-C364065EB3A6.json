  "summary": "SEA (Syrian Electronic Army) is back again, Yesterday they hacked two UKs news websites, The Sunday Times and The Sun.  For about 20 minutes, the websites were hacked and defaced with a message showing in the image above, after that company restored the website to its original state.  A News UK spokesman said its digital team mobilised quickly, pinpointing the area of attack within minutes and then shutting the technical window to prevent the attack continuing.  We were back up within 20 minutes of the attack, he said, with full access to all parts of the site expected to be back up in the near future.  The Sun Tweeted, After recovering:  Good news! Our website is back up and running, which means business as usual. Kim Kardashians racy pics, anyone?",
