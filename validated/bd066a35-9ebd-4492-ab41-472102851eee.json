  "summary": "Landmark Cancer Center in Rogers claimed its competitor, Highlands Oncology Group, attempted to encrypt Landmark's computer system last year and engaged in other deceptive and illegal actions.  Landmark claims, for instance, around May of last year someone used the credentials of a former employee who had recently gone to work at Highlands to enter Landmark's computer system and install ransomware, a type of malicious program that often encrypts a computer's files and demands payment to restore access to them. Landmark claims this person continued trying to install the program even as Landmark worked to undo the damage.",
