  "summary": "Hackers have stolen email addresses during a cyber-attack on the Neuch\u00e2tel Cantonal Bank, but the bank says the data is old and of limited value.  There was a cyber attack on the Neuch\u00e2tel Cantonal Bank (BCN) at the beginning of August, spokeswoman Marie-Laure Chapatte, told the \u00abAWP\u00bb news agency (in German), resulting in the potential theft of around 1,500 email addresses.  Neither the banking infrastructure - such as the online banking platform - nor other sensitive systems were affected by the attack on August 4 and 5, the bank added.   BCN said the attack was \u00abcontained quickly\u00bb. There was also no attempt at extortion or ransom demands as in ransomware attacks.  Nothing of Value Taken?  The attackers succeeded in exploiting a vulnerability in the BCN website that has since been dealt with. An external expert was brought in to analyze the situation more thoroughly.  \u00abThe bank believes it is adequately protected from the threat of a cyber-attack,\u00bb the spokeswoman said.  Some of the information that the hackers accessed was old and dates back to 2012.  \u00abDue to the poor quality of the data, we were unable to contact those potentially affected because we could not always identify them,\u00bb Chapatte added.  That sounds alarming, but all in all the bank thinks it is in a position to identify those potentially affected.  The BCN revealed the incident on its website last week.",
