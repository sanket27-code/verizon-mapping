  "summary": "A Brooklyn marketing office was inundated for months by hundreds of private medical documents meant for Quest Diagnostics, but couldn't get anyone at the clinical laboratory services company to take action until she called NBC 4 New York's I-Team. Gabby Klotzman started working for APS Marketing Group in Flatbush in April and almost immediately noticed faxes meant for Quest Diagnostic coming into her office, she says.  The faxes were all medical papers, with sensitive information, including name, date of birth, phone numbers, and sometimes social security numbers for patients. They almost always included the type of the test that was being ordered for the individuals and were faxed from many different medical offices in the New York metropolitan area.  ",
