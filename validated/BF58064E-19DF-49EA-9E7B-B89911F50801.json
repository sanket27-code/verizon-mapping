  "summary": "A Nigerian national has been charged in connection with a hack of Los Angeles County emails that might have exposed personal data from more than 750,000 people who had business with county departments, officials said. Kelvin Onaghinor, 37, faces nine counts, including unauthorized computer access and identity theft, according to the Los Angeles County Chief Executive Office. He hasn't been arrested, and officials aren't sure if he is on U.S. soil.  Authorities were searching for more suspects in the hack, which occurred in May when a phishing email deceived 108 county employees into providing their usernames and passwords. Some of those employees, according to officials, had \"confidential client/patient information\" in their email accounts through their county responsibilities. A forensic examination found that about 756,000 individuals could have been affected through their contact with several departments, the Daily News reported Saturday.  That information may have included first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license or state identification numbers, payment card information, bank account information, home addresses, phone numbers, and/or medical information, such as Medi-Cal or insurance carrier identification numbers, diagnosis, treatment history or medical record numbers.",
