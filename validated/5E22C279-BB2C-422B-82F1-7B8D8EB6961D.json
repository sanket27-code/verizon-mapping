  "summary": "An organisation that works with mental health patients is trying to mop up the mess it created by a somewhat old-fashioned privacy breach.  It lost documents containing the names, addresses and clinical details of 65 of its clients, when a staff member left their bag on a Wellington bus last month.  Full referral notes for one person, and the staff members diary were also in the bag.  Pathways chief executive, Jacqui Graham says senior staff have personally apologised to 49 of those affected.  She says Pathways is also giving its clients information about lodging an official complaint.  The bag still hasnt been found.",
