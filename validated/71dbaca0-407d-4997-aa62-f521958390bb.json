  "summary": "Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services found something on a number of gas pumps throughout the state in the wake of Hurricane Dorian.  Inspectors checking gas stations for damage had to remove 15 credit card skimmers from gas pumps.  Crooks place the devices on pumps in hopes of stealing credit card and bank account information from drivers who swipe their credit and debit cards on them.  Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried issued a statement reading, in part:\u201cWhile we\u2019re confident consumers should feel safe fueling up post-storm, we encourage anyone suspecting issues to report them to us at 1-800-HELP-FLA or FloridaConsumerHelp.com.\u201d  Authorities say to avoid having your information stolen, you should pay inside the gas station rather than at the pump and never use a debit card.  As for damage, inspectors found that flooding from Dorian infiltrated just two of the 250 gas stations along Florida's East Coast that were most likely to be impacted by the storm. ",
