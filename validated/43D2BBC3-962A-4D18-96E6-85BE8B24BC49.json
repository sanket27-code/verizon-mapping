The note, written in English, says the hacker group has access to intranets, mail servers and web servers, The Next Web reports.  The group further claims to have started the Operation Free Korea movement, urging the country to sack its leader and install a democracy.  \"We got all over 15k membership records of Uriminzokkiri.com and many more,\" the note reads.  \"First we gonna wipe your data, then we gonna wipe your badass dictatorship 'government'.\"  Originally published as Hackers 'stole 15k N Korea passwords'",
