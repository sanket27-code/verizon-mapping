  "summary": "The blood donation service of the Bavarian Red Cross has sent health-related data from potential donors to Facebook, including intimate information on HIV infections, pregnancies, drug use or diabetes. This reports the \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\" in her Tuesday edition.  The blood donor data was collected for months on a \"pre-check\" on the website  blutspendedienst.com  , which is operated by the non-profit subsidiary of the Bavarian Red Cross.  Volunteer donors can apparently click anonymously through a survey on diseases and other reasons that exclude them from donating. However, as the controversial \" Facebook Pixel\" advertising tracker was included in the site, the replies were sometimes transferred to the ad network in conjunction with the donor's Facebook accounts.",
