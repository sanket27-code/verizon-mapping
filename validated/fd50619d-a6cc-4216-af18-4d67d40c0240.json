  "summary": "The four casino workers generated false \u201ccoin-in\u201d amounts on the electronic gaming machines, including video slots, which resulted in \u201cfraudulent\u201d credit vouchers for the same totals, the indictment says.  Mechanically, the four workers connected one end of a wire to a device inside a gaming machine \u201cthat would recognize coins.\u201d They then connected the other end of the wire to another metal surface inside the cabinet that would cause the machine to generate the coin-in amounts.  To erase their tracks, the indictment says, they \u201cconducted a \u2018hard reset\u2019 or \u2018RAM clear\u2019 of the [gaming machine], which would delete the history of the false and fraudulent \u2018coin-in\u2019 amounts from the [machine].\u201d  The total take was $5.3 million, according to federal prosecutor Dwayne Williams. The alleged computer fraud scheme lasted from Jan. 29, 2011 to May 27, 2015.  All eight of the defendants committed money laundering by taking the stolen casino funds and buying real estate, investment properties, vehicles and college savings plans in Florida, the indictment says.
