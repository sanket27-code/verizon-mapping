  "summary": "Surveillance photos have provided a good lead, but the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office needs the public's help to find the man who installed skimmers at three SunTrust Bank ATMs around the Bay area.  \"I probably use this the ATM here at the SunTrust at least once every couple of weeks,\" said Dave Goodwin.  We caught up with the customer as he used the ATM at 403 W. Brandon Blvd., but he had no idea that the same machine had a skimming device attached to it just last week.  \"That kind of bothered me a little bit,' Goodwin said.  The suspect also hit the location at 9601 Dr. MLK Blvd. East and 3511 Bell Shoals Rd. in Valrico by installing a long, thin silver box which contains electronic equipment and a camera above the keypad to record the customer's key strokes.  \"In this particular case the skimmer house is attached to an electronic device that is actually copying and photographing you as you punch the keypad,\" said Larry McKinnon, spokesperson for the Hillsborough Co. Sheriff's Office.",
