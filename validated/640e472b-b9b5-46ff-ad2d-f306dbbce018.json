As a result, LSU HCSD has in its files certain information related to the care of Moss Memorial patients.  On December 10, 2020, LSU HCSD notified Lake Charles Memorial that a cyber intruder had accessed LSU HCSD\u2019s e-mail system.  The intruder accessed a mailbox that contained approximately 185,000 LSU HCSD e\u2011mails.  One of those e-mails included a spreadsheet attachment that contained limited information about approximately 3,800 Moss Memorial patients.  This occurred on September 15, 2020.",
