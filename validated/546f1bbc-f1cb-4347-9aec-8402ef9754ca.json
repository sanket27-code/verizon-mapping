  "summary": "A dry bulk ship in port had just completed bunkering operations. The bunker surveyor boarded the ship and requested permission to access a computer in the engine control room to print documents for signature. The surveyor inserted a USB drive into the computer and unwittingly introduced malware onto the ship\u2019s administrative network. The malware went undetected until a cyber assessment was conducted on the ship later, and after the crew had reported a \u201ccomputer issue\u201d affecting the business networks.",
